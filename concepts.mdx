Amplication provides a powerful set of features that work together to help you achieve your goals as a platform team.
This page provides a high-level overview of the core concepts behind these features.

## Blueprints

Blueprints are standardized templates that define the structure and configuration of your organization's resources, from microservices to infrastructure, acting as a single source of truth for your architectural standards. They also incorporate properties for customization and relations to define connections between resources, ensuring consistency and reducing technical drift across all your projects while enabling complex, interconnected systems.

## Private Plugins

Private Plugins are custom code extensions that hook into Amplication's code generation engine, allowing you to tailor the generated code to your organization's specific needs and technology choices. They enable you to codify your internal best practices and enforce architectural standards directly within the generated code, ensuring every resource adheres to your guidelines.

## Catalog Properties

Catalog Properties are organizational metadata that you can apply to all your Amplication resources, providing a centralized and standardized way to tag, describe, and categorize them. These properties enable you to gain enhanced visibility, improve governance, and even influence code generation based on resource characteristics like domain, environment, or compliance level.
