Amplication provides a powerful set of features that work together to help you achieve your goals as a platform team.
This page provides a high-level overview of the core concepts behind these features.

## Blueprints

Blueprints are standardized templates that define the structure and configuration of your organization's resources, from microservices to infrastructure, acting as a single source of truth for your architectural standards. They also incorporate properties and relations to define connections between resources, ensuring consistency and reducing technical drift across all your projects while enabling complex, interconnected systems.

## Plugins

Plugins are custom code extensions that hook into Amplication's code generation engine, allowing you to tailor the generated code to your organization's specific needs and technology choices. They enable you to codify your internal best practices and enforce architectural standards directly within the generated code, ensuring every resource adheres to your guidelines.

## Smart Git Sync

Smart Git Sync automates the synchronization of changes between Amplication and your Git repositories, ensuring that all updates to your resources are systematically tracked and version-controlled. By automatically creating branches and pull requests for Amplication-driven changes, Smart Git Sync streamlines your workflow, facilitates collaboration, and maintains a clear audit trail of all modifications to your codebase.

## Resources

Resources are concrete implementations of blueprints within your ecosystem.
They represent actual software components like services, SDKs, deployment repos, and other components.
Each resource is customizable while maintaining the standards defined by its blueprint, including properties, relations, and plugin configurations. Resources must be connected to a Git repository, either directly or inherited from their project.

## Projects

Projects organize your resources, templates, and plugins into logical groups. They provide a structured way to manage your ecosystem and control access to resources. Projects help you visualize relationships between resources and maintain clear ownership structures.

## Entities

Entities are data models that define the structure of your application's database tables. They include fields and relationships that map to database columns and connections. Entities automatically generate API endpoints for data operations, providing a foundation for your application's data layer.
