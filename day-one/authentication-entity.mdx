Amplication's **Authentication Entity** provides a standardized, pre-configured foundation for user management and security in your resources.
It's **required** if you want to add authentication to your resource.

<Note>
By default, Amplication uses a `User` entity as the Authentication entity.
When you enable an authentication plugin, Amplication automatically creates this `User` entity (or prompts you to create it) with all the necessary fields.
You can also use your own custom entity, as long as it includes the required fields.
</Note>

## Why is the Authentication Entity Required?

Authentication plugins in Amplication, such as the NestJS Auth Module for Node.js Blueprints and ASP.NET Core Identity for .NET Blueprints, rely on a properly defined Authentication entity.
The plugins use this entity to manage user logins, permissions, and overall security.
**Without a correctly configured Authentication entity, authentication plugins won't work.**

Essentially, the Authentication entity provides a:

## Change the Default Authentication Entity

You have the flexibility to designate a different entity as your Authentication entity if the default `User` entity doesn't perfectly fit your data model.

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Resource Settings">
Navigate to your resource's **Settings** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Authentication Entity Settings">
Find and click on the **Authentication Entity** settings in the left side bar.
</Step>

<Step title="Select New Entity">
Use the **Entity List** dropdown to choose the entity you want to use as your new Authentication entity.

</Step>
</Steps>

You've now successfully changed the default Authentication entity for your service.

<Note>
If the required fields are missing, your authentication plugins will not function correctly.
</Note>

## Add Default User Entity

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Entities">
Go to **Entities** tab in your Amplication resource.
</Step>

<Step title="Create New Entity">
Click **Add Entity** ➔ Name it `User` ➔ Click **Create Entity**
</Step>

<Step title="Restore Default Fields">
Confirm restoration of default fields when prompted

<Note>
For Node.js resources: Add this _before_ enabling NestJS Auth Module.
For .NET: Create before ASP.NET Core Identity setup.
</Note>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Required Fields

To work smoothly with authentication plugins, your Authentication entity needs specific fields.

| Field         | Required | Unique | Description                          |
|---------------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Yes      | Yes    | Auto-generated unique identifier     |
| `createdAt`   | Yes      | No     | Automatic timestamp on creation      |
| `updatedAt`   | Yes      | No     | Automatic timestamp on modification  |
| `username`    | Yes      | Yes    | Login identifier (searchable)        |
| `email`       | Yes      | Yes    | User's email address (searchable)    |
| `password`    | Yes      | No     | Securely hashed credentials          |
| `roles`       | Yes      | No     | Permission group assignments         |
| `firstName`   | No       | No     | User's first name (searchable)       |
| `lastName`    | No       | No     | User's last name (searchable)        |

These default fields are designed to cover the most common authentication scenarios.
They give you a robust starting point for user management and security.

<Note>
If you use the default `User` entity, Amplication automatically sets these up for you.
</Note>

## Delete the Authentication Entity

While you can typically delete any entity you create in Amplication, the Authentication entity is a bit different because of its central role in security.
**To delete the Authentication entity, you must first disable all authentication plugins in your service.**

This means disabling:

* **NestJS Auth Module** (and any other authentication plugins) for resources based on the Node.js blueprint.
* **ASP.NET Core Identity** plugin for resources based on the .NET blueprint.

<Steps>
<Step title="Disable Authentication Plugin">
Go to your service's **Plugins** page. Disable the authentication plugin(s) for your service type.

   *   **Node.js:** Toggle the **NestJS Auth Module** to the "off" position. Disable any other authentication plugins you may have installed.
   *   **.NET:** Disable the **ASP.NET Core Identity** plugin.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Entities">
Go to your service's **Entities** page.
</Step>

<Step title="Delete Entity">
You'll now see that the delete button for the Authentication entity is enabled. Click the **delete button** next to the Authentication entity. A confirmation popup will appear.

</Steps>

<Check>
**The Authentication entity is now removed from your resource.**
You'll have to re-enable your authentication plugin and potentially recreate the Authentication entity if you need authentication again in the future.
