## Understanding Authentication in Amplication

Amplication takes a **plugin-based approach** to authentication that dramatically simplifies this critical aspect of development. By providing a variety of authentication providers through plugins, you can quickly implement robust security without getting bogged down in complex configurations.

<Note>
**Pre-requisite**: Before enabling authentication, you'll need an **Authentication Entity** in your Amplication service. This entity represents the users who will be authenticated. If you haven't set this up yet, visit our [Authentication Entity Guide](/day-one/authentication-entity).
</Note>

## Key Benefits of Plugin-Based Authentication

Our authentication system offers several strategic advantages for platform teams:

## Implementation Process

Follow these steps to add authentication to your service:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an Authentication Provider">
    Choose from our range of authentication plugins:
    - JWT for stateless authentication
    - Basic Auth for simple implementations
    - Auth0 for enterprise identity
    - And more options for both Node.js and .NET
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Plugin">
    Use our intuitive UI to:
    - Install your chosen auth plugin
    - Configure provider-specific settings
    - Set up authentication parameters
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Secure Code">
    Amplication automatically creates:
    - Authentication middleware
    - Security endpoints
    - Configuration files
    - Authorization guards
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop Your Features">
    With authentication handled, focus on:
    - Core application features
