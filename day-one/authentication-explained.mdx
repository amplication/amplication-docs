Amplication simplifies this critical aspect of development by providing a **plugin-based authentication system** with a variety of providers. This allows you to easily add and manage robust authentication to your services without getting bogged down in intricate configurations.

## Amplication's Approach: Plugin-Based Authentication

We have designed our authentication system around plugins. This approach offers several advantages for platform teams:

  <Card title="Flexibility to Choose" icon="shuffle">
    Select the authentication method that best fits your organization's security policies and application requirements. Whether it's industry-standard JWT, or integration with enterprise providers like Auth0 or Keycloak, Amplication has you covered.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Standardization and Best Practices" icon="shield-check">
    Plugins are pre-configured with security best practices in mind, ensuring your services are secure from the outset. This aligns with your goal of working with established, well-maintained standards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reduced Boilerplate" icon="code">
    Amplication generates the necessary authentication code, eliminating the tedious and repetitive setup work. You can focus on your business logic, not wrestling with authentication libraries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Implementation" icon="arrows-repeat">
    By using Amplication's plugin system across your services, you ensure a consistent authentication approach throughout your organization. This addresses the pain point of inconsistent standards and "drift" between services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simplified Updates" icon="arrows-rotate">
    As authentication best practices evolve, Amplication's plugin system can be updated, and these updates can be seamlessly applied to your services, reducing maintenance burden and technical debt.

## How it Works

<Note>
To enable authentication, you'll first need to have an **Authentication Entity** defined in your Amplication service. This entity represents the users who will be authenticated against your service. If you haven't already, learn how to create an Authentication Entity in our [Authentication Entity Guide](/how-to/add-delete-user-entity).
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Provider">
    Amplication offers a range of authentication provider plugins (like JWT, Basic Auth, Auth0, Supertokens, and more) for both **Node.js** and **.NET** services.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install and Configure">
    With just a few clicks in the Amplication UI, you can install the necessary plugins and configure them to match your chosen provider and specific needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Amplication Generates the Code">
    When you build your service, Amplication automatically generates all the authentication logic, including middleware, endpoints, and necessary configurations, based on the plugins you've selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focus on Your Application">
    You can then concentrate on developing the core features of your application, knowing that authentication is handled securely and consistently by Amplication.
  </Step>
