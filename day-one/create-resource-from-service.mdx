**Services** generate a complete codebase using Amplication's opinionated standards for Node.js or .NET development.
You can customize every aspect of the generated code to fit your existing software ecosystem, or use it as a foundation if you haven't established your own standards yet.

Service resources use Amplication's best-in-class Node.js and .NET code generation engine to produce human-readable, best-practice code.
If you're comfortable with Node.js or .NET, or need to spin up a backend quickly, creating a service is a great fit.

<Note>
**Services vs Blueprints**: Amplication opinionated services are based on pre-configured templates and technologies in .NET or Node.js, configurable through our various plugins available out of the box.
Blueprints, on the other hand, let you build your own standards and templates in any language or technology.
</Note>

## Tech Stack Options

Amplication maintains production-ready code generation engines for both Node.js and .NET.
Our plugin-based architecture ensures maximum flexibility, allowing you to customize every aspect of your service.
With dozens of plugins available in our public catalog, you can easily adapt the generated code to match your preferences.

  - [Sample .NET Service](https://github.com/amplication/dotnet-8-sample-generated)
</Tip>

Each service type comes with a carefully curated stack of enterprise-grade technologies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Node.js" icon="node">
    - **Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - Enterprise-ready framework with robust architecture patterns
    - **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Next-generation database toolkit
    - **Admin UI**: Optional [React Admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) interface
    - **API Documentation**: Swagger UI and OpenAPI specifications
    - **Testing**: Jest for unit and E2E testing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title=".NET" icon="microsoft">
    - **Framework**: [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) - High-performance, cross-platform framework
    - **ORM**: [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) - Modern object-database mapper
    - **API Documentation**: Built-in Swagger/OpenAPI support
    - **Authentication**: Identity framework integration
    - **Testing**: xUnit for comprehensive testing
  </Accordion>

## Create Your Service

<Steps>

<Step title="Choose Technology Stack and Name">
  Name your new service to clarify its primary purpose and select either Node.js
  or .NET as your base technology stack.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/day-one/create-service-step-1.png" />
  </Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Git Integration">
Next, connect your new service to a Git repository.
Select an existing repository or create a new one.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/day-one/create-service-step-2.png" />
  </Frame>

<Info>
You can modify these Git settings later through the service settings.
For detailed configuration options, see [Git Integration](/git-integration).
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Select Initial Features">
Choose the core features for your service:

- REST API with Swagger UI
- GraphQL API
- Admin UI interface

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/day-one/create-service-step-3.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
GraphQL API and Admin UI features are currently available for Node.js services only.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Repository Structure">
Choose between:

- **Monorepo**: Services are generated into subfolders within a shared repository
- **Polyrepo**: Each service gets its own dedicated repository

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/day-one/create-service-step-4.png" />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Choose Database">
Select your preferred database:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/day-one/create-service-step-5.png" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
**You're not locked in**: Amplication uses a plugin-based approach, allowing you to switch databases later without major refactoring.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Authentication">

Choose whether to include built-in authentication:

- Enable for secure access management
- Skip if you handle authentication elsewhere

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/day-one/create-service-step-6.png" />

<Note>
Authentication providers can also be modified later through our plugin system.
Learn more in our [Authentication guide](/day-one/authentication-explained).

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your initial service, it's time to customize it to meet your specific needs. Here are the key steps to get started:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Add Entities & Fields" icon="database" href="/day-one/entities">
    Start building your data model by creating entities and defining their fields. This forms the foundation of your service's functionality.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom Types & Actions" icon="code" href="/day-one/custom-types-actions">
    Extend your service by creating custom types and actions to implement specific business logic and API endpoints.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Jovu AI" icon="microchip-ai" href="/day-one/jovu">
    Accelerate development by leveraging Jovu, our AI assistant, to help generate entities, fields, and relationships automatically.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Generate Code" icon="laptop-code" href="/day-one/generate-code">
    Build and sync your service to generate production-ready code that implements all your defined configurations and customizations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By choosing Amplication's **opinionated Node.js or .NET service option**, you're using time-tested code patterns and focusing on real business logic while still having the freedom to edit every line of the service as you see fit.
