**Entities** represent the data models that power your resource and serve as the foundation for your APIs and database interactions.
This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about creating and managing entities in Amplication to accelerate your development process.

<Note>
Amplication **Entities** feature is available when using the **.NET** or **Node.js** blueprints in Amplication.
</Note>

## What Are Amplication Entities?

In Amplication, an **entity** represents a data model or domain object in your application. For example, you might define entities like `User`, `Order`, or `Product`.
Each has its own fields, default values, and relationships.
With Amplication, defining and managing entities becomes streamlined and intuitive, allowing you to:

## How to Create an Entity

Creating a new entity in Amplication is simple and intuitive using Amplication's UI.
Each entity automatically gets an **ID**, **Created At**, and **Updated At** field so you can start building right away without repetitive setup.

<Tip>
You can also upload an existing database schema to quickly create multiple entities. Learn more about [uploading schemas](/day-one/upload-schema).
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Entities Page">
First, locate your resource in Amplication. Then, open the **Entities** tab. You will see a list of existing entities for your resource.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a New Entity">
Click **Create New**. In the dialog that appears, enter the name of your entity and confirm by clicking **Create Entity**.

<Tip>
You can also create entities using [Jovu](/day-one/jovu), Amplication's AI assistant. Simply ask Jovu to create an entity, and it will generate appropriate fields based on the entity's name.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Review Auto-Generated Fields">
After creating an entity, Amplication automatically provides the `ID`, `Created At`, and `Updated At` fields to get you started quickly. You can add or modify additional fields later based on your requirements.

<Warning>
**Avoid Reserved Names**  
For a list of reserved entity and field names, check out our [reserved names reference](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/packages/amplication-server/src/core/entity/reservedNames.ts). Using a reserved name can cause issues in the generated code.
</Warning>

## Visualize Entities with ERD View

Amplication provides an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** view to give you a clear, graphical representation of your entities and their fields.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the ERD View">
Navigate to the **Entities** page for your resource. Look for the toggle switch near the search bar and flip it to switch from the list view to the ERD view.
</Step>

<Step title="Explore Your Diagram">
Use pinch-to-zoom or your trackpad's scroll to zoom in and out. You can also click and drag to rearrange entities for better visibility.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Why It Matters:**  
Seeing a visual layout of your entities helps you quickly identify potential gaps or inconsistencies. This high-level view also makes it easier to communicate changes across multiple teams.
</Note>

## Next Steps

By automating repetitive tasks around entity creation and maintenance, Amplication enables you to focus on what really matters like building robust business logic.
