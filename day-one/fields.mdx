Each entity is composed of fields which define the attributes of that entity, such as `name`, `email`, or `price`. This page will guide you through creating and configuring entity fields within Amplication.

<Note>
The Entities, Fields, and Relationships features are currently available for projects using **Node.js** and **.NET** blueprints.
</Note>

## Create New Fields

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the Entity Screen">
Click the **Entities** icon in the main menu (left toolbar). This will display a list of all entities in your application.
</Step>
<Step title="Select an Entity">
Click on the entity you want to modify. This will open the Entity's page, displaying its existing fields.
</Step>
<Step title="Add a New Field">
Type the name of your field.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Field Details">
* **Display Name:** The user-friendly name shown in the Amplication UI (e.g., "Customer Email")
* **Name:** The camelCase name used in code and APIs (e.g., `customerEmail`)
* **Description:** Optional context about the field's purpose (e.g., "Primary email address for customer communications")
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can use Amplication's AI, [Jovu](/day-one/jovu), to simplify field creation for your entities using natural language.
</Tip>

## Field Settings

Each field offers optional settings to control its behavior and constraints:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unique Field" icon="fingerprint">
    <p>Toggle **Unique Field** to ensure that each value in this field is unique across all instances of the entity. This is crucial for fields like email addresses or usernames where duplication isn't allowed.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Required Field" icon="asterisk">
    <p>Activate **Required Field** to make sure that this field must have a value when creating a new entity instance. This prevents incomplete data entries and enforces data integrity for critical attributes.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Searchable" icon="magnifying-glass">
    <p>Enable **Searchable** to allow users to search for entity instances based on the values in this field. Note that field visibility for search results is still controlled by permissions settings.</p>
    <Info>Even if a field is not set as **Searchable**, if permissions allow, the field's data will still be included in search results when searching by other searchable fields.</Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Available Data Types

Select the appropriate data type to define what kind of information your field will store. Each data type is optimized for specific use cases and provides built-in validation and handling.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Single Line Text" icon="font">
        For short text strings like names or titles. You can set a maximum length to enforce data constraints.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Multi-Line Text" icon="align-left">
        For longer text content like descriptions or notes. You can configure a maximum length.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Email" icon="envelope">
        Specifically for email addresses, ensuring data is in a valid email format.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Username" icon="user">
        Optimized for usernames, with a configurable maximum length.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Password" icon="lock">
        Designed for storing passwords securely. You can set a maximum length.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Whole Number" icon="hashtag">
        For integer values. You can select the database field type (Integer or Big Integer) and set minimum and maximum allowed values.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Decimal Number" icon="calculator">
        For numbers with decimal places. You can choose the database field type (Decimal or Float), define minimum and maximum values, and set the precision level.

        For true/false values.
    </Card>
    <Card title="JSON" icon="brackets-curly">
        For storing flexible, schema-less data in JSON format. Excellent for custom fields and adapting to evolving data needs.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Option Set" icon="list">
        For fields that can only take one value from a predefined list of options (single-select dropdown).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Multi-Select Option Set" icon="list-check">
        Similar to Option Set but allows selecting multiple options from the list (multi-select dropdown).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Geographic Location" icon="location-dot">
        For storing geographic coordinates.
    </Card>
    <Card title="File" icon="file">
        For storing file metadata. Configure maximum file size, allowed MIME types, and container path for file storage.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Roles" icon="user-shield">
        For managing user roles and permissions within your application.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Relation to Entity" icon="link">
        Used to establish connections between different entities.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Default Fields

Amplication automatically creates essential fields for every entity:

* **`id`**: A unique identifier for each entity instance. By default, it's a CUID, but you can customize it to UUID, auto-increment integer, or auto-increment big integer.
* **`createdAt`**: Automatically tracks the creation timestamp of each entity instance.
* **`updatedAt`**: Automatically updates with the timestamp whenever an entity instance is modified.

## Advanced Customization

For developers who need fine-grained control over their fields, Amplication provides Custom Attributes. These attributes allow you to directly leverage Prisma's powerful schema customization features within the Amplication UI.

<Note>
Advanced Customization is only available for **Node.js** blueprints.
</Note>

You can add field-level attributes (prefixed with `@`) to customize individual field properties. These are accessible in the **Custom Attributes** text field within each field's settings page.

Common field-level attributes include:
* **`@unique`**: Enforce uniqueness for a field
* **`@default(...)`**: Set a default value
* **`@map("column_name")`**: Map to a different column name
* **Native database types**: Specify database-specific data types (e.g., `@db.VarChar(200)`)

<Note>
Refer to [Prisma's documentation on field attributes](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#attributes) for a comprehensive list of available attributes and functions.
