Amplication's AI helps you adopt an AI-driven approach to resource creation and maintenance.
It's powered by Jovu, our AI assistant that translates natural language requests into production-ready code, aligning each new or updated resource with your organization's best practices.

## How Amplication AI Helps Your Team

Jovu empowers platform teams to define and maintain organizational standards through **natural language descriptions** of blueprints, catalog properties, and live templates.

Developers can accelerate their workflow using natural language commands to create and modify resources without deep knowledge of the UI.
This allows them to quickly activate plugins, edit catalog properties, change Git repositories, add entities and fields, or manage relationships, all while reducing time spent on repetitive tasks and configuration.
