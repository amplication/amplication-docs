**Relationships** are the links that connect your entities, allowing you to model complex data structures and build sophisticated resources.
This guide will walk you through creating and managing entity relationships, enabling you to establish clear connections between your data models.

<Note>
Amplication **Relationships** feature is available when using the **.NET** or **Node.js** blueprints.
</Note>

## What are Entity Relationships in Amplication?

Entity relationships in Amplication represent how different data models interact and are connected within your resource.
Think of them as the lines that connect tables in a database, but visualized and managed in Amplication.

At the database level, relationships are often implemented using **Foreign Keys**.
Amplication abstracts this complexity, allowing you to define relationships visually. This makes it straightforward to:

* **Navigate between related data:** Easily access related entities in your application code and APIs.
* **Simplify GraphQL queries:** Retrieve related data efficiently with automatically generated GraphQL resolvers.
* **Enforce data integrity:** Maintain consistency and accuracy across your data model by clearly defining how entities are linked.

## Types of Relationships

Amplication supports the following core relationship types:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="One-to-One" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
        A relationship where each instance of one entity is related to at most one instance of another entity, and vice-versa.

        **Example:** A `User` entity and a `UserProfile` entity. Each user has only one profile, and each profile belongs to only one user.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="One-to-Many (Many-to-One)" icon="arrow-right-to-bracket">
        A relationship where one instance of an entity can be related to multiple instances of another entity. From the perspective of the "many" side, it's a Many-to-One relationship.

        **Example:** A `Project` entity and a `Task` entity. One project can have many tasks, but each task belongs to only one project.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Many-to-Many" icon="arrows-left-right">
        A relationship where multiple instances of one entity can be related to multiple instances of another entity.

        **Example:** A `Student` entity and a `Course` entity. Many students can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students.

        <Tip>
        Currently, true Many-to-Many relationships are configured in Amplication by creating two One-to-Many relationships and an intermediary "join" entity. This provides flexibility and explicit control over the relationship.
        </Tip>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Self-Relation" icon="rotate">
        Sometimes, an entity needs to relate to itself. This is common for hierarchical data structures, such as organizational charts or comment threads. Amplication supports **self-relations**.
        
        When you create a "Relation to Entity" field and select the **same entity** as the "Related Entity", you are creating a self-relation. Amplication will automatically create **two** relationship fields on the same entity to represent both directions of the relationship.

        **Example:** In a `User` entity, you could create a self-relation to represent managers and employees, where each user can have one manager and multiple employees.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to Create a Relationship

Creating relationships in Amplication is straightforward using the UI. You'll use the "Relation to Entity" data type to create these connections.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Entity Fields">
        Go to the **Entities** tab and select the entity you want to modify to create a relationship from. Then, navigate to the **Fields** tab of that entity.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add a New Field and Select 'Relation to Entity'">
        Click **Add Field**. In the "Data Type" dropdown for the new field, choose **Relation to Entity**.

        <Frame caption="Selecting 'Relation to Entity' data type">
            <img src="/images/day-one/relation-to-entity.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose the Related Entity">
        In the **Related Entity** dropdown, select the entity you want to connect to. This is the entity that will be related to the current entity you are modifying.

        <Frame caption="Selecting the related entity">
            <img src="/images/day-one/related-entity.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure Relationship Details">
        Configure the cardinality for both sides of the relationship. The options will dynamically adjust based on the relationship type you are creating.

        For example, when creating a **One-to-Many** relationship from `Project` to `Task`:

        1. On the `Project` entity's "Tasks" field, you would select: "**One 'Project' can be related to many 'Tasks'**".

        2. Amplication automatically creates a corresponding relationship field on the `Task` entity (e.g., "Project"). On the `Task` entity's "Project" field, the cardinality would be pre-selected as: "**One 'Task' can be related to one 'Project'**".

        <Frame caption="Configuring One-to-Many Relationship Cardinality">
            <img src="/images/day-one/one-to-one-relation.png" />
        </Frame>

        <Note>
        For **One-to-One** relationships, you need to specify which entity will hold the **Foreign Key**. The Foreign Key is how the database links the two entities.
        
        * **"This side"**: The current entity you are editing will hold the Foreign Key.
        * **"Other side"**: The related entity will hold the Foreign Key.
        
        The placement of the Foreign Key impacts data dependencies. If Entity B holds the Foreign Key referencing Entity A, then Entity B cannot exist without Entity A. However, Entity A can exist independently.
        </Note>
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For complex data models, we recommend using Amplication's AI, [Jovu](/day-one/jovu), to help you establish entities and relationships efficiently.
</Tip>

## Visualize Relationships with the ERD View

Amplication's **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** view becomes even more valuable when working with relationships. It provides a visual map of how your entities are connected, making it easier to understand and manage complex data models.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access ERD View">
        Navigate to the **Entities** tab and switch to the ERD view using the toggle near the search bar.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Examine Relationships">
        In the ERD view, you will see lines visually connecting related entities. The type of relationship (One-to-One, One-to-Many) is indicated by the line style or icons on the connector.

        <Frame caption="ERD View showing relationships between entities">
            <img src="/images/day-one/relationships-erd-view.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

The ERD view is crucial for:

* **Validating your data model:** Quickly ensure relationships are set up as intended.
* **Communicating data structure:** Easily explain the data model to team members and stakeholders.
* **Identifying potential issues:** Spot circular dependencies or incorrect relationship types early in the development process.
