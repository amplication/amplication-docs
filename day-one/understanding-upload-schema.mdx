</Note>

When you upload your DB Schema into Amplication, you are initiating a process that transforms your schema into Amplication's internal entity model. This page dives deep into how Amplication converts your Prisma database schema into Amplication's internal structure.

## The 3-Step Conversion Process

During the schema upload, you'll see logs detailing a three-phase conversion process:

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate: Ensuring Schema Integrity">
The first step validates the syntax and structure of your `schema.prisma` file against Prisma's conventions. This ensures your schema is well-formed and ready for conversion.  Crucially, it also checks for the presence of models – the building blocks of your services.  Without models, the conversion process cannot proceed, ensuring a valid starting point.

<Tip>
  This validation step is your first line of defense against schema errors,
  preventing issues down the line and ensuring a smooth import process.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Prepare: Aligning with Amplication's Standards">
The preparation phase standardizes your schema, applying five key transformations to ensure consistency and maintainability across all services generated by Amplication. This step is critical for platform teams aiming to enforce organizational standards and reduce technical drift.

These transformations include:

- **Model Names:** Standardizing to PascalCase, singular, and no underscores.
- **Field Names:** Standardizing to camelCase and no underscores.
- **Field Types:** Ensuring consistent type references between models.
- **Model IDs:** Simplifying primary key definitions for clarity and consistency.
- **Model ID Field:** Guaranteeing a standardized `id` field for each entity.
  </Step>

<Step title="Convert: Optimizing Data Types for Amplication">
In the final conversion step, Prisma's data types are mapped to Amplication's internal data types. This ensures optimal performance and functionality within Amplication's service generation framework. This mapping includes handling specific DateTime attributes for `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` fields, and translating Prisma's type system to Amplication's more abstract types like `Lookup` for relations and `OptionSet` for Enums.

This step ensures that your database schema is not just imported, but intelligently adapted to Amplication's architecture, maximizing efficiency and developer experience.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Validate - First Pass Schema Check

This step acts as an initial quality gate, confirming that your `schema.prisma` is syntactically correct and contains the essential elements – models – necessary for Amplication to build upon. This quick check prevents wasted time and ensures the conversion process begins with a valid schema.

## Step 2: Prepare - Standardizing for Consistency and Maintainability

This phase is where Amplication's conversion happens. By applying these five operations, Amplication ensures that all generated services adhere to consistent naming conventions and structural patterns.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Model Names: PascalCase, Singular, No Underscores" icon="folder-tree">

Amplication enforces **PascalCase**, **singular**, and **underscore-free** naming conventions for models. This standardization is vital for code readability and maintainability, especially across large teams and numerous services.

To maintain database compatibility and prevent data loss, Amplication intelligently uses Prisma's `@@map` attribute.
If your original model name deviates from Amplication's conventions, `@@map` is automatically added, preserving the original database table name while using the standardized name within Amplication.

<Note>
  If you have already used `@@map` attributes in your schema, Amplication
  respects your existing mappings and does not overwrite them.
</Note>

**Example:**

```diff schema.prisma
-model course_rating
+model CourseRating {
  id        String    @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
  rating    Int

+@@map("course_rating")
}
```

This ensures that while your Amplication service code uses `CourseRating`, the underlying database table remains `course_rating`, preventing any disruption to existing data or systems.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Field Names: camelCase, No Underscores" icon="signature">

Similar to model names, field names are standardized to **camelCase** and must be **underscore-free**. This consistency improves code readability and reduces cognitive load for developers working across different services.

Just like with model names, Amplication uses Prisma's `@map` attribute to preserve your original database column names when necessary. This ensures seamless integration with existing databases and prevents unexpected data mapping issues.

<Note>
  Existing `@map` attributes on fields are also respected and not overwritten
  during this process.
</Note>

**Example:**

```diff schema.prisma
model Product {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  name        String?
-item_price  Float?
+itemPrice   Float?    @map("item_price")
  description String?
  orders      Order[]
}
```

Here, `item_price` is converted to `itemPrice` in your Amplication service, while the `@map("item_price")` attribute ensures the database column remains `item_price`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Field Types: Ensuring Model Relationships" icon="link">

This operation focuses on ensuring that field types accurately reflect relationships between models. When you import a schema, especially from an introspected database, Prisma might use generic model names in relation fields. Amplication refines these to use the standardized, PascalCase model names established in the previous step.

**Example:**

```diff schema.prisma
-model products
+model Product {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  name        String?
  itemPrice   Float?
  description String?
- orders      orders[]
+ orders      Order[]
}

-model orders
+model Order {
  id         String    @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt  DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime  @updatedAt
  totalPrice Int?
- product    products?  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
+ product    Product?  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
  productId  String?
}
```

Here, `products` and `orders` are corrected to `Product` and `Order` respectively, ensuring the relationship is clearly defined and consistent with Amplication's model naming standards.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model IDs: Simplifying Primary Keys" icon="key">

Amplication standardizes the way primary keys are defined in your schema. It simplifies the `@@id` attribute, which in Prisma can define composite IDs, to focus on single-field primary keys, which aligns with Amplication's entity structure.

<Note>
  Composite IDs (`@@id([field1, field2])`) are currently not fully supported in
  Amplication.
</Note>

This operation performs several key transformations:

- `@@id([field])` is converted to `@@unique([field])`. The original `@@id` is replaced with a `@@unique` constraint to maintain uniqueness in the database.
- The field originally designated as the primary key via `@@id` now becomes the _actual_ ID field within Amplication. The `@id` attribute is added to this field.
- If the field lacks a `@default()` attribute (like `cuid()` for String IDs or `autoincrement()` for Int IDs), Amplication adds one based on the field's type. This ensures every entity has a properly configured default ID generation strategy.
- If the primary key field isn't named "id", it's renamed to "id", and a `@map` attribute is added to preserve the original field name in the database.
- Finally, the `@@unique` attribute is updated to reference the new "id" field: `@@unique([originalFieldName])` becomes `@@unique([id])`.

**Example:**

```diff schema.prisma
model DomainUnit {
+ id   String @id @default(cuid()) @map("domainId")
- domainId String
  unitId   String

- @@id([domainId])
+ @@unique([id])
}
```

This ensures a consistent and predictable ID structure across all entities in Amplication.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model ID Field: Ensuring a Standard 'id' Field" icon="fingerprint">

The final preparation step guarantees that every model has a standardized `id` field. This is a fundamental principle in Amplication, ensuring consistent entity identification across your services.

This operation handles two main scenarios:

- **Non-ID fields named 'id':** If a field is named `id` but _isn't_ an ID field (doesn't have the `@id` attribute), it's renamed to `${modelName}Id` to avoid naming conflicts with the actual ID field that Amplication will ensure exists. A `@map` attribute is added to preserve the original name in the database.
- **ID fields with different names:** If an ID field (with the `@id` attribute) has a name other than `id`, it's renamed to `id`. Again, a `@map` attribute is used to maintain the original field name in the database.

**Example:**

```diff schema.prisma
model RandomName {
- randomId         Int     @id
+ id                Int     @id @map("randomId")
- id               Int?
+ randomNameId      Int?    @map("id")
  fullName          String
}
```

This operation ensures that every Amplication entity has a clearly defined and consistently named `id` field, simplifying data access and relationships within your services.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Convert - Mapping Prisma Types to Amplication Data Types

The final conversion step maps Prisma's data types to Amplication's internal data types, optimizing them for service generation and functionality within the Amplication ecosystem.
This step ensures that your data is represented in a way that best leverages Amplication's features and capabilities.

Here's a table summarizing the Prisma to Amplication data type conversions:

| Prisma                         | Amplication            | Description                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `String` (ID)                  | `Id`                   | Converts ID fields with `String` type to Amplication `Id` type, defaulting to `cuid()` for ID generation.      |
| `Int` (ID)                     | `Id (autoincrement)`   | Converts ID fields with `Int` type to Amplication `Id` type, using `autoincrement()` for ID generation.        |
| `Boolean`                      | `Boolean`              | Direct mapping for Boolean types.                                                                              |
| `DateTime` (`@default(now())`) | `CreatedAt`            | `DateTime` fields with `@default(now())` are converted to Amplication's specialized `CreatedAt` type.          |
| `DateTime` (`@updatedAt`)      | `UpdatedAt`            | `DateTime` fields with `@updatedAt` are converted to Amplication's specialized `UpdatedAt` type.               |
| `DateTime`                     | `DateTime`             | Plain `DateTime` fields remain as `DateTime` in Amplication.                                                   |
| `Float`, `Decimal`             | `Decimal Number`       | Prisma's `Float` and `Decimal` types are converted to Amplication's `Decimal Number` type.                     |
| `Int`, `BigInt`                | `WholeNumber`          | Prisma's `Int` and `BigInt` types are converted to Amplication's `WholeNumber` type.                           |
| `String`                       | `SingleLineText`       | Standard `String` fields are converted to Amplication's `SingleLineText` type, suitable for short text inputs. |
| `Json`                         | `Json`                 | `Json` types are directly equivalent.                                                                          |
| `Enum`                         | `OptionSet`            | Prisma `Enum` types are converted to Amplication's `OptionSet`, providing structured choice options.           |
| `Enum[]`                       | `MultiSelectOptionSet` | Prisma `Enum[]` arrays are converted to `MultiSelectOptionSet`, allowing multiple selections from options.     |
| Model relation                 | `Lookup`               | Relations to other models are converted to Amplication's `Lookup` type, establishing entity relationships.     |

## Common `Id` Field Conversion Scenarios

The `id` field is central to Amplication's entity model, and its conversion requires careful handling.
Here are common scenarios you might encounter:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Scenario 1: Existing @default Attribute on 'id' Field" icon="circle-exclamation">
If your `id` field already has a `@default` attribute, Amplication removes it. This is because Amplication automatically adds a `@default` attribute that aligns with the `id` type (e.g., `cuid()` or `autoincrement()`) during conversion.  Having multiple `@default` attributes is invalid in Prisma schema.

**Example:**

```graphql
// Original model (After Introspection)
model User {
  id Int @default(0)
  name String
}

// After Importing Into Amplication
model User {
  id Int @default(autoincrement())
  name String
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scenario 2: Model Without a Suitable 'id' Field" icon="circle-plus">
If a model lacks a field that can serve as the `id`, Amplication proactively adds an `id` field. This ensures every entity in Amplication has a clearly defined primary identifier. The added `id` field is of type `String` and defaults to `cuid()` for generating unique IDs.

**Example:**

```graphql
// Original model (After Introspection)
model Product {
  price Decimal @unique
  name String
}

// After Importing Into Amplication
model Product {
  id String @id @default(cuid())
  price Decimal @unique
  name String
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scenario 3: Multiple Unique Fields, One Named 'id'" icon="list-ol">
If multiple fields could potentially become the `id` field (e.g., multiple `@unique` fields), and *one* of them is already named `id`, Amplication prioritizes the field named `id`. This field is then designated as the primary `@id` and configured with an appropriate `@default` attribute (like `autoincrement()` for Int types).

**Example:**

```graphql
// Original Model (After Introspection)
model User {
  email String @unique
  name String @unique
  id Int @unique
}

// After Importing Into Amplication
model User {
  email String @unique
  name String @unique
  id Int @unique @id @default(autoincrement())
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scenario 4: No Unique Field Named 'id'" icon="i-cursor">
In cases where no unique field is named `id`, Amplication selects a unique field (often the first one encountered) and renames it to `id`.  To maintain database integrity, a `@map` attribute is added, mapping the new `id` field back to its original name in the database.

**Example:**

```graphql
// Original Model (After Introspection)
model User {
  email String @unique
  name String @unique
  username Int @unique
}

// After Importing Into Amplication
model User {
  id String @unique @map("email")
  name String @unique
  username Int @unique
}
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Log Warnings: Addressing Potential Issues

During schema processing, Amplication provides logs, including `(Info)` and `(Warning)` messages. While the schema will still process with warnings, it's crucial to review them. Warnings indicate potential discrepancies or areas where the conversion might not perfectly align with your original schema's intent. Addressing warnings proactively can prevent unexpected behavior in your generated services.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/day-one/import-prisma-schema-log.png" />
</Frame>

Here are the most common warning scenarios you might encounter and how to address them:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Custom Attributes on Enum Keys" icon="list">
Amplication's `OptionSet` and `MultiSelectOptionSet` types handle Enums effectively. However, Amplication currently does not fully support custom attributes like `@map` or `@@map` directly on Enum keys or Enums themselves.

If your Prisma schema uses these attributes on Enums, they will **not** be preserved in the converted schema.

**Impact:** If your application logic relies heavily on these custom mapping attributes for Enums, you'll need to manually adjust the generated `schema.prisma` or your application code to ensure correct behavior after importing into Amplication.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Composite IDs on Models" icon="key">
As mentioned earlier, Amplication's entity model primarily works with single-field IDs. If your Prisma schema uses composite IDs defined with `@@id([field1, field2, ...])`, Amplication adapts this by:

- Converting `@@id` to `@@unique` to maintain database-level uniqueness constraints.
- Adding a new, singular `id` field (String type, `cuid()` default) to the model to serve as Amplication's primary identifier.

**Impact:** While data integrity is maintained through the `@@unique` constraint, the shift from a composite ID to a singular `id` might require adjustments in how you design relationships and queries within Amplication. Be mindful of this change when working with entities that originally used composite IDs.

Amplication logs warnings when it encounters models with `@@id` attributes and no existing `id` field, alerting you to this conversion.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
