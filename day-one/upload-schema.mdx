If you have a database you'd like to use as the foundation for your new resource you can upload a `schema.prisma` file based on your database.
Amplication will instantly create entities, fields, and relationships based on your schema, significantly accelerating your development process and letting you focus on business logic, not database setup.
This feature quickly translates your existing database structure into Amplication's internal model, giving you a ready-to-go starting point.

<Note>
The **Upload Schema** feature is powered by Prisma's Introspection CLI. Learn more about it on [Prisma's docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/introspection).
Also, this feature is only available when using the **.NET** or **Node.js** blueprints in Amplication.
</Note>

## Overview

When you upload a Prisma schema, Amplication inspects your existing database structure and generates corresponding entities, fields, and relationships. By standardizing and automating the process, Amplication helps you maintain consistency and best practices across your organization, saving significant time and reducing technical debt.

## Run the Introspection Process

To generate a Prisma schema from your existing database, you'll use Prisma’s introspection feature.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Prisma CLI">
If you haven't already, install the Prisma CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g prisma
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Prisma Schema File">
Create a file named `schema.prisma` in your project. In this file, set the `url` in the `datasource` block to point to your existing database:
```graphql schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=sample"
}
```
Adjust the URL according to your database provider (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).
</Step>

<Step title="Run Prisma Introspection">
Navigate to the directory with your `schema.prisma` file, then run:
```bash
prisma db pull
```
This inspects your database and generates models within `schema.prisma`.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate Your Generated Schema">
Open `schema.prisma` in a text editor to ensure it’s error-free and follows your organization's naming conventions or best practices. If you notice issues (e.g., missing relations or improperly named fields), make the necessary adjustments.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If the introspection results in errors or incomplete models, refer to [Prisma’s Error Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/error-reference) for guidance.
</Warning>

## Create Your Initial Migration (Optional)

If you plan to use Prisma Migrate on your newly introspected database, consider “baselining” your database to align existing data with future migrations.

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize a Migrations Folder">
Create a directory for your initial migration, for example:
```bash
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/init_after_introspection
```
</Step>

<Step title="Generate a Baseline Migration Script">
In the same directory as your `schema.prisma`, run:
```bash
prisma migrate diff \
  --from-empty \
  --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
  --script > prisma/migrations/init_after_introspection/migration.sql
```
Review the generated `migration.sql` to ensure accuracy.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply the Baseline Migration">
Mark your newly created migration as already applied:
```bash
prisma migrate resolve --applied init_after_introspection
```
This step records the migration in the `_prisma_migrations` table without making changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Upload Your Prisma Schema File to Amplication

Once your `schema.prisma` file is ready, upload it to Amplication from the **Resources** section of your service.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Your Resource in Amplication">
Locate the service resource where you want to import your database schema.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Entities">
Click on the "Entities" tab in the navigation bar of your resource to access the entities page.
</Step>

<Step title="Click 'Upload Schema'">
Select **Upload Schema** on the top-right corner of the page.

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Attach Your File">
Upload your `schema.prisma` file using the provided form.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/day-one/upload-prisma-schema.png" />
</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If the uploaded schema is invalid or lacks identifiable entities, Amplication will halt the process and display an error. Ensure your `schema.prisma` file is valid before proceeding.
</Warning>

## Check the Conversion Logs

After uploading, Amplication displays a log detailing the conversion of your Prisma models into entities. Review these logs to confirm that:

- All expected models are detected.
- Fields and relationships match your existing database structure.
- No warnings require further action.

</Frame>

<Warning>
Schema uploads can’t be redone in the same project. Ensure your schema and logs are correct before proceeding.
</Warning>

## Review Your Newly Created Entities

Once conversion completes successfully, Amplication creates entities and fields corresponding to your models. You can visualize these in the **ERD view** to confirm relationships align with your database design.

## Apply Your Migration to the New Amplication Service

If you generated baseline migrations earlier or have an existing migration history, you can now merge that with your new Amplication resource:

<Steps>
<Step title="Commit Changes">
Commit the newly generated entities and configuration to your preferred Git repository.
</Step>

<Step title="Update Environment Variables">
In your `.env` file (or your deployment environment), set the `DB_URL` to your existing database’s connection string.
</Step>

<Step title="Copy Migrations Folder">
Move or copy the previously created `migrations` folder into the `prisma` directory of your new Amplication service repository.
</Step>

<Step title="Run Database Commands">
From within your service’s root directory, install dependencies and generate your Prisma client:
```bash
npm i
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:migrate-save
```
This aligns your Amplication resource with your existing database.
</Step>
</Steps>
