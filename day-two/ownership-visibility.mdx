## Enhanced Visibility Across Your Software Ecosystem

Knowing who is responsible for each service is crucial for maintaining a healthy and manageable software ecosystem.
Amplication directly integrates Users and Teams with the **Workspace Catalog** and **Architecture Graph** to provide unparalleled visibility into resource ownership.

<Steps>
<Step title="Define Owners for Every Resource">
  Assign ownership at the resource level, whether it's a service, blueprint, or any other component within Amplication.  Owners can be individual users or entire teams, providing flexibility to align with your responsibility models.

  <Note>
    Learn more about configuring resources and their settings in the [Resource Configuration](/day-one/edit-catalog-properties) guide.
  </Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Visualize Ownership in the Catalog">
  The **Workspace Catalog** provides a dedicated "Owner" column, instantly displaying the team or individual responsible for each resource. This eliminates ambiguity and provides a single source of truth for service ownership.

    </Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Filter by Owner in the Architecture Graph">
  Leverage the **Architecture Graph** to filter and visualize your entire service landscape based on team or individual ownership. Quickly identify which teams are responsible for specific parts of your architecture, facilitating better planning and coordination.

## Proactive Notifications for Updates

Staying on top of updates and changes across a growing number of resources can be challenging.
Amplication proactively addresses this by integrating ownership with a robust notification system.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automated Notifications to Owners" icon="bell">
    When updates are available for a resource – whether it's a blueprint update, template enhancement, plugin version upgrade, or any other relevant change – Amplication automatically notifies the designated owners (teams or individuals).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintain Up-to-Date Resources Easily">
    By linking ownership to notifications, Amplication empowers your teams to efficiently manage updates and maintain the health of their services. This streamlined process minimizes manual tracking and ensures timely responses to critical updates.
