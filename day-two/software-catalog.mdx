Amplication's **Software Catalog** provides the strategic control and governance you need to manage your entire service and resource landscape effectively. Think of the Software Catalog as your organization's single source of truth for all resources built with Amplication.

## Why It Matters for Platform Teams

## Grid Columns

The grid interface provides detailed information about each resource through carefully designed columns.
Each column serves a specific purpose in helping you understand, manage, and maintain your resources effectively.
Here's what each column represents:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project" icon="folder">
    The project column helps you identify which project each service belongs to within your organization. This is particularly useful in the workspace catalog view where you're managing services across multiple projects. It helps maintain clear organizational boundaries and simplifies resource management across your enterprise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Blueprint" icon="sitemap">
    Blueprints define the foundational structure and configuration of your services. This column shows which blueprint each service is based on, helping you track standardization across your services and ensure consistent implementation of architectural patterns and best practices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Owner" icon="user">
    The owner column displays the team or individual responsible for each service, establishing clear lines of accountability and facilitating efficient communication. This information is crucial for large organizations managing multiple services across different teams.

  <Accordion title="Code Generator" icon="code">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Code Gen Version" icon="code-merge">
    Track and manage the version of the code generator being used by each service. This information is vital for maintaining consistency and planning upgrades across your service ecosystem. You can choose to automatically update versions or lock them to specific versions based on your needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Git Repo" icon="github">
    Monitor the connected Git repository for each service, providing crucial information for version control and deployment tracking. This column helps you maintain clear connections between your services and their source code, simplifying development workflows and audit processes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pending Changes" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Track modifications that haven't been committed or built yet for each service. This feature helps you maintain awareness of ongoing development work and ensures no changes are overlooked during your development process.
