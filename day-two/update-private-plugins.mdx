After publishing Private Plugins and using them to create capabilities for your blueprints, you may need to update them. To ensure your plugins remain effective, secure, and aligned with evolving best practices, keeping them updated is essential.

**Updating Private Plugins** in Amplication is a streamlined process that ensures you can easily roll out new features, bug fixes, and improvements to all resources utilizing your plugins. This process also notifies existing resources using the plugin, and incorporating updates is as simple as merging a PR.

      <li><strong>Fixing bugs</strong>: Resolve any issues or defects in your plugin's logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Improving performance</strong>: Optimize your plugin for better efficiency and speed.</li>
      <li><strong>Updating dependencies</strong>: Ensure compatibility and security by updating underlying libraries or dependencies.</li>
    </ul>

## Resource Notifications of Plugin Updates

Once you've published a new version of your Private Plugin, Amplication helps you ensure that your resources are aware of and can adopt the updates:

- **Automatic Notifications**: Amplication sends in-product notifications and emails to relevant teams, informing them about the availability of a new plugin version.
- **Technical Debt Alerts**: The Technical Debt tab for services and templates using your plugin will highlight that a new plugin version is available. This provides a clear prompt to upgrade to the latest version.

<Tip>
   By updating your Private Plugins, you are proactively managing the technical health of your Amplication-powered ecosystem and ensuring everyone benefits from the latest improvements and standards you've implemented.
