Amplication provides **both opinionated and agnostic approaches** to backend software development.
You can use Amplication's built-in standards for rapid development or define your own standards using [Custom Blueprints](/day-zero/blueprints) and [Private Plugins](/day-zero/private-plugins).
This flexibility lets your team optimize their development workflow while maintaining completely control over their software ecosystem.

## Choosing the Right Approach

When using Amplication, you can decide to use our built-in standards or create your own custom standards.

<Tip>
It's possible to mix standards within the same project. You can have resources that use your own custom resources and also resources that use Amplictation's built-in standards.

## Amplication's Built-in Standards

Use Amplication's pre-configured standards for .NET and Node.js. They include automatic management of data models, API endpoints, and DTOs. Amplication also provides a catalog of public plugins that generate code for common functionalities, such as authentication, identity management, and database integrations.

## Custom Standards

You can define your own standards and structure by building Private Plugins that generate code based on specific configurations and requirements that you need.
This approach lets you:

## Feature Differences

The following features are available in the built-in standards but are not currently available in custom standards:

| Feature                     | Built-in Standards | Custom Standards                                     | Notes                                                                                                |
