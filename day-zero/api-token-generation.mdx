Amplication's integrations enable you to access your templates, resources, and [version alerts](https://www.notion.so/day-one/create-resource-from-template#tech-debt) through your existing Internal Developer Platform (IDP). These integrations can help you link Amplication resources to your various environments and servers.

## ## **Token Generation Process**

You can easily generate an API token through your workspace settings. Here's how:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Got to Settings">
    Go to "Settings" in your workspace and find "API Tokens" in the right sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create API Token">
    Click "Create API Token" and provide a descriptive name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Token">
    Copy your token immediately - it won't be shown again after leaving the page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Important Token Information:**
- Tokens automatically refresh their 30-day expiration period with each API use
- Each token inherits the permissions of the creating user
- Users can only view their own tokens
