Amplication's **Catalog Properties** empower you to **tag and describe all resources** in a centralized, standardized way.
By applying these properties, you can filter, order, group, visualize, and even influence **generated code** to align with your organization’s standards.

## Why Resource Management Matters

As a platform team, you need to ensure that every new or existing resource in your software ecosystem follows your organization’s best practices, security requirements, and architecture standards.
This presents several challenges:

- **Lack of Centralized Visibility:** It's challenging to get a unified view of all your services and resources, making it difficult to enforce standards and track compliance.
- **Difficulty in Understanding Resource Relationships:** Without consistent tagging, understanding the relationships and dependencies between various components can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Inconsistent Resource Definitions:** Variations in how resources are described can lead to confusion, hindering effective management and updates.
- **Limited Ability to Enforce Standards:** Without a structured way to categorize resources, enforcing architectural and security standards across the organization becomes difficult.

## How Catalog Properties Help

**Catalog Properties** directly address these challenges by letting you establish a **common language** for describing and managing all resources in your Amplication workspace.
They let you:

<Note>
**Catalog vs. [Blueprint Properties](/day-zero/blueprint-properties-relations)**

Blueprint Properties define the configuration of a specific resource.
Catalog properties, on the other hand, are **organizational metadata** that apply broadly across all resources for filtering, grouping, governance, and more.
</Note>

## Smart Code Generation with Catalog Properties

Catalog Properties aren't just for organizing your resources. They also **connect into code generation via plugins**.
When you generate code using Private Plugins, you have full access to:

- **Catalog Properties** of the specific resource.  
- **Blueprint Properties** of the resource.  
- **Catalog & Blueprint Properties** of all related resources set through Blueprint relations.

This means you can **adapt generation logic** based on any property.

- **Compliance Level** triggers the inclusion of stricter security modules.  
- **Deployment Environment** adjusts Dockerfiles, Helm charts, or serverless config.  
- **Team Ownership** adds certain logging or monitoring integrations relevant for that team.

<Tip>
**Private Plugin Property Access**: Catalog Properties are always available in the plugin context for code generation so you can easily maintain enterprise-wide consistency, whether you're generating microservices, infrastructure as code, or messaging configurations.
</Tip>

## Example Use Cases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Domain Organization" icon="sitemap">
    Keep services organized by business domain, enabling quick filtering and grouping in both the [Service Catalog](/day-two/software-catalog) and [Architecture Graph](/day-two/architecture-graph).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deployment Environment Configuration" icon="server">
    Clarify how each resource is hosted or run, and tailor code generation or CI/CD logic based on the environment selected.

## Access & Manage Catalog Properties

You can manage all your Catalog Properties from a single interface so that you have one source of truth for your organizational metadata.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Amplication Workspace">
    Access your workspace within the Amplication platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the 'Settings' Tab">
    Find and select the "Settings" tab in the navigation bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to 'Catalog Propeties'">
    In the settings sidebar, locate and click on "Catalog Properties".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and Manage Catalog Properties">
    From this central location, you can create new properties, modify existing ones, and manage their configurations and default values.
  </Step>
</Steps>
