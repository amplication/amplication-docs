Amplication’s integrations allow you to view your templates, resources and in some cases even your [Outdated Version Alerts](/day-one/create-resource-from-template#tech-debt) in an IDP which you already use, where you can link between Amplication’s resources to your various servers or environments.

## Token

In order for you to use an integration, you need to obtain your Amplication token. The token can easily be generated in your workspace’s settings page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access User Management">
    Navigate to the "Settings" section in your workspace and select "API Tokens" in the lower part of the right sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Token">
	  Click on the "Create API Token" button in the top right part of the page. Give your token a discriptive name and click the "Create Token" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Token">
	  Copy the generated token either by selecting it clicking `Ctrl/Cmd+C` or right-click and "Copy" or by clicking the "Copy Token" button. Paste the code before leaving the page since the code **won't be visible again**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Tokens are valid for 30 days following creation or last use. The 30 day expiration period automatically refreshes with each API.
</Note>

<Info>
  Tokens are created with the permissions of the user who creates them, and each user can only see their own tokens.
