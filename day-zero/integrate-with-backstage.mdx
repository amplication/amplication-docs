Amplication provides an easy integration option with **Backstage**. With this integration, you can use Backstage’s catalog alongside with Amplication ability to scaffold a resource with a few clicks. Amplication currently has two Backstage plugins, with one relying on the other:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Catalog Backend Module Plugin">
        This plugin fetchs templates data from your Amplication account into your Backstage Catalog, and emits them as Backstage components with spec type **ServiceTemplate**. It uses a [custom processor](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/external-integrations/#custom-processors) to do so, running in fixed intervals.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Scaffoledr Backend Module Plugin">
        This plugin provides Backstage template [action](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/builtin-actions) for Amplication. The action is called `amplication:scaffold-service` and it enables you to call Amplication's API in order to scaffold a service with the givven name, description (optional) and template.
        This plugin comes with an example template, which we reccomend to register within Backstage, outlining the process easily.
        
      <Info>
				The plugin relies on a list of templated (i.e. components with a spec type **ServiceTemplate**) so you will want to install both plugins.

    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

You can see your templates when browsing to to your Home tab, and searching for components. You can narrow the search using `Type=ServiceTemplate` or `Tags=amplication` or `Tags=servicetemplate` .

When browsing to **Create…**, you can see the **Scaffold a New Service** service, and it will allow you to scaffold an Amplication service using your templates.
