Amplication can be integrated with any [Internal Developer Platform (IDP)](/day-zero/integrate-with-idp).

## Prerequisites

- A workspace in Amplication
- An API token for the workspace

## Amplication + GraphQL

Amplication is built with GraphQL in mind. This means that you can easily integrate Amplication with any IDP using by calling the GraphQL API.

## Authentication

Your calls to the Amplication GraphQL API will need to be authenticated. You should use the [API token](/day-zero/api-token-generation) to authenticate your calls. This is done by sending the token in the `Authorization` header of your request:

```http
Authorization: "Bearer <token>"
Content-Type: "application/json"
```

## Requests

Since we're working with GraphQL, we'll need to make requests to the GraphQL endpoint. The endpoint is `https://server.amplication.com/graphql` and it will accept POST requests for queries and mutations:

### Templates

The following request will return all the templates available in the Amplication server:

<RequestExample>
```json Request
query searchCatalog($where: ResourceWhereInputWithPropertiesFilter, $take: Int, $skip: Int) {
    catalog(where: $where, take: $take, skip: $skip) {
        totalCount
        data {
            id
            name
            description
            resourceType
            project {
                id
                name
            }
            blueprint {
                id
                name
            }
        }
        __typename
    }
}
```
```json Variables
{
  "take": 100,
  "skip": 0,
  "where": { "resourceType": { "in": ["ServiceTemplate"] } }
}
```

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "catalog": {
      "totalCount": 1,
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "name": "Service Template 1",
          "description": "Service Template 1 Description",
          "resourceType": "ServiceTemplate",
          "project": {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Project 1"
          },
          "blueprint": {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Blueprint 1"
          }
        }
      ],
      "__typename": "ResourceConnection"
    }
  }
}
```
</RequestExample>
