## Integrating Amplication with Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

Amplication provides a powerful way to standardize and accelerate backend development, and integrating it with Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) unlocks even greater efficiency. Whether you're using Backstage, Port, or another IDP, Amplication seamlessly fits into your platform to streamline service creation, enforce best practices, and maintain consistency across your engineering organization. This guide outlines how to connect Amplication with any IDP using its GraphQL API, allowing you to synchronize templates, automate service scaffolding, and enhance your development workflow with a fully integrated experience.

    - Token: Enter your [Amplication workspace token](/day-zero/api-token-generation)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    After clicking "Connect", it will take a few minutes for the connection to fetch all the data from Amplication to Port.
  </Step>
</Steps>
