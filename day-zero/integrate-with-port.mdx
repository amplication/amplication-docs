Amplication provides seamless integration with **Port**. With this integration, you can continue using Port’s catalog and all other features including Amplication’s templates, resources and outdated version alerts.

## Configuration

To get started, you have to have an active Port account. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Data Sources Page">
    Go to (Data Sources)[https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources] page in the Builder section of Port's app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on the '+ Data Source' button">
    Find and select the "+ Data Source" button in the navigation bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look for Amplication">
    Under "Scaffolding", you should find Amplication. Click on the logo to proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill the New Data Source Form">
    There are only two fields to fill, the host which should be filled by default with "https://server.amplication.com/graphql", which is fine, and the token which you generated in your Amplication workspace (settings page)[/day-zero/effortless-integration#token].
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    After clicking "Connect", it will take a few minutes for the connection to fetch all the data from Amplication to Port.
