Amplication provides seamless integration with **Port**. With this integration, you can continue using Port’s catalog and all other features including Amplication’s templates, resources and outdated version alerts.

## Configuration

To get started, you have to have an active Port account. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Data Sources Page">
    Go to [Data Sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page in the Builder section of Port's app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on the '+ Data Source' button">
    Find and select the "+ Data Source" button in the navigation bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look for Amplication">
    Under "Scaffolding", you should find Amplication. Click on the logo to proceed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill the New Data Source Form">
    There are only two fields to fill, the host which should be filled by default with "https://server.amplication.com/graphql", which is fine, and the token which you generated in your Amplication workspace (settings page)[/day-zero/effortless-integration#token].
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    After clicking "Connect", it will take a few minutes for the connection to fetch all the data from Amplication to Port.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Builder

In the [builder view](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model), you can see the three Amplication blueprints: Amplication Template, Amplication Resource and Amplication Version Alert.

### Catalog

In the [catalog section](https://app.getport.io/organization/catalog), you have four pages, three of them are index pages showing all synced data (Amplication Templates,  Amplication Resources, Amplication Version Alerts) and the Amplication Dashboard, showing everything you need to know about alerts, templates and resources.

### Self-service

In the [actions portion](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) for Port, you can find two actions:

1. **Scaffold a Service** (under **Create Actions**): enables you to scaffold a service from a template.
2. **Code Re-build** (under **Day-2 Operations**): allowing you to send a re-build command for a specific resource, with a message.
