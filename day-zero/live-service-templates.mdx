Amplication's **Live Service Templates** let you effortlessly create and manage standardized, auto-updating services at scale.
They build on top of Amplication's production-ready [Services](/day-one/create-resource-from-service/) which use our best-in-class Node.js and .NET code generators.

## Why Live Service Templates?

As a platform team, you're focused on increasing developer velocity while maintaining control and consistency across your organization's growing software ecosystem.
Live Service Templates directly address the challenges you face in managing hundreds or thousands of software resources across multiple teams:

## Templates vs Blueprints

Live Service Templates focus specifically on creating standardized auto-updating services at scale. They build on Amplication's opinionated Node.js and .NET code generators, letting you combine them with your organizational standards through plugins, catalog properties, and custom settings.

Blueprints help you establish and maintain your organization's standards by providing a flexible framework for defining and generating any type of software resource. They enable you to codify your best practices through private plugins across any type of software like infrastructure, front-end apps, custom tooling, and more.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Blueprints" icon="diagram-project">
    <ul>
      <li>Technology-agnostic resource generation</li>
      <li>Great for integrating your own frameworks, languages, or infrastructure</li>
      <li>Can define anything from Dockerfiles to Azure Functions to React apps</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Live Service Templates" icon="server">
    <ul>
      <li>Focused on Node.js and .NET services</li>
      <li>Built on Amplication's opinionated code generators</li>
      <li>Include built-in boilerplate, best practices, optional Admin UI, and more</li>
      <li>Ideal for quickly spinning up readable service code using Amplication's standards</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

These two approaches can coexist. If you do not yet have your own standards or would like to adopt Amplication's standards, you can use Live Service Templates for your Node.js and .NET services. Blueprints help you to establish and maintain your own standards, and they also have the ability to generate services.

<Tip>
  All resources can be versioned and updated through Amplication. Learn more about managing updates across multiple resources in our [Technical Debt Management Guide](/day-two/resolve-debt-across-multiple-resources).

    From the platform console, select the Create Template option to begin defining your new Live Service Template.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Live Service Templates Work

When you create a Live Service Template, you effectively:

1. **Choose the Stack**: Node.js or .NET (Amplication's core code generators)
2. **Bundle Config & Plugins**: Combine public plugins (from Amplication's catalog) or private plugins (your own internal ones) to bake in your requirements
3. **Define Service Settings**: Lock down the code generator version, set up standard APIs (REST, GraphQL), pick a database, and more
4. **Publish**: Make this template available to your organization

When you update a Live Service Template—whether it's updating plugin versions, addressing security requirements, or implementing new logging standards—Amplication automatically manages the propagation of these changes across all services that use the template.

## Template Configuration

Let's walk through the practical steps of creating and configuring your own Live Service Template in Amplication.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Name Template and Choose Stack">
    Begin by giving your template a descriptive name and selecting either Node.js or .NET as your core technology stack. This foundation determines which of Amplication's opinionated code generators will be used.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-1.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      Refer to our [Services page](/day-one/create-resource-from-service/) for insight on Amplication's opinionated Node.js and .NET stacks.
    </Note>
  </Step>

   <Step title="Configure Initial Technologies">
    Define the core APIs and services your template will provide. Whether you're building Node.js or .NET services, you can select the combination of technologies that best suits your organizational needs.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-2.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Database">
    Choose your preferred database. Thanks to this flexible plugin-based approach, you can easily switch between different database options in the future without major refactoring.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-3.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      **You're not locked in**: Amplication uses a plugin-based approach, allowing you to switch databases later without major refactoring.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Plugins">
    Open your template's <strong>Plugins</strong> tab to install or configure any combination of:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public plugins</strong>: Officially supported by Amplication</li>
      <li><strong>Private plugins</strong>: Your internal compliance rules, custom cloud integrations, or anything else you maintain yourself</li>
    </ul>

    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Template Settings">
    Fine-tune your template's configuration through settings like resource ownership, code generator versioning, and [catalog properties](/day-zero/catalog-properties) to match your organization's requirements.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-5.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Template">
    Make your template available to your organization by publishing it with semantic versioning and a descriptive changelog.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-6.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      After publishing, you can view version history and detailed changes in the **Versions tab**. When your dependencies or standards change, update the template and republish. Amplication will automatically notify all services that inherit from it.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>
