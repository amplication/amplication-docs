Amplication's **Live Templates** let you define "golden paths" through pre-configured combinations of plugins that standardize technology choices, security practices, and architectural patterns across your organization. By turning any resource—whether a **Blueprint** or an **Amplication Service**—into a published template with its selection of plugins, you ensure consistency from day one and greatly simplify long-term maintenance.

Once published, these templates enable rapid creation of new resources while automatically pushing updates to existing ones. The result is faster development, fewer repetitive tasks, and significantly reduced technical drift across your ecosystem.

## Why Live Templates?

As a platform team, you're focused on increasing developer velocity while maintaining control and consistency across your organization's growing software ecosystem.
**Live Templates directly address the challenges you face in managing hundreds or thousands of software resources** across multiple teams:

## Create a Template from an Existing Blueprint Resource

You can turn any **Blueprint-based** resource into a Live Template.
For example, suppose you have a Terraform blueprint or a React front-end blueprint that includes your organization’s security guidelines.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Resource">
    In your **Project Catalog**, select the existing blueprint-based resource with all the configurations you want to replicate.

    <Info>
      Before creating a blueprint-based template, you'll need an existing blueprint resource. Learn how to create one in our <a href="/day-one/create-resource-from-blueprint">"Create a Resource from a Blueprint"</a> guide.
    </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Template from Resource">
    Open its details page and click <strong>Create Template from Resource</strong>. Amplication will generate a new Live Template with the same plugins, settings, or code generation rules as the original.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/create-template-from-resource.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Your Template">
    This will create a new unpublished template from the specified blueprint resource.
    The template will become available to your organization to use after publishing.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To learn how to create a new resource **from** this blueprint-based template and customize it before publishing, check out our <a href="/day-one/create-resource-from-template">"Create a Resource from a Template"</a> guide.

## Create a Template from a Service

If you’ve built an Amplication **Node.js or .NET** service that includes carefully chosen dependencies, security plugins, or domain logic, you can capture it as a Live Template.
This ensures new services across the organization all start with your proven foundation.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Name Template and Choose Stack">
    Begin by giving your template a descriptive name and selecting either Node.js or .NET as your core technology stack. This foundation determines which of Amplication's opinionated code generators will be used.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-1.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      Refer to our [Services page](/day-one/create-resource-from-service/) for insight on Amplication's opinionated Node.js and .NET stacks.
    </Note>
  </Step>

   <Step title="Configure Initial Technologies">
    Define the core APIs and services your template will provide. Whether you're building Node.js or .NET services, you can select the combination of technologies that best suits your organizational needs.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-2.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Database">
    Choose your preferred database. Thanks to this flexible plugin-based approach, you can easily switch between different database options in the future without major refactoring.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-3.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      **You're not locked in**: Amplication uses a plugin-based approach, allowing you to switch databases later without major refactoring.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Plugins">
    Open your template's <strong>Plugins</strong> tab to install or configure any combination of:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public plugins</strong>: Officially supported by Amplication</li>
      <li><strong>Private plugins</strong>: Your internal compliance rules, custom cloud integrations, or anything else you maintain yourself</li>
    </ul>

    </Frame>

    <Note>
      Learn more about the differences in our [Private vs Public Catalog Plugins](/day-zero/private-vs-public-plugins) guide.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Template Settings">
    Fine-tune your template's configuration through settings like resource ownership, code generator versioning, and [catalog properties](/day-zero/catalog-properties) to match your organization's requirements.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-5.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Template">
    Make your template available to your organization by publishing it with semantic versioning and a descriptive changelog.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/day-zero/live-service-template-configuration-step-6.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      After publishing, you can view version history and detailed changes in the **Versions tab**. When your dependencies or standards change, update the template and republish. Amplication will automatically notify all services that inherit from it.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## View Resources Created from a Template

To see which resources were created from a specific template:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Platform Console">
    Go to **Platform** in your Amplication workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the Template">
    From the **Templates** list, click on the template you want to inspect.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Resources Tab">
    You'll see a list of all resources that originated from this template, along with each resource's template version.
    This gives you immediate visibility into which teams are using your template and whether they've merged the latest updates.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Keep Derived Resources in Sync

One of the most powerful benefits of Live Templates is **auto-updating** derived resources:

1. **Update the Template**  
      When you revise a template (upgrade a plugin, fix a security gap, add new environment settings), Amplication captures these changes in your "Platform Changes."
   <Note>
     To learn more, visit the [Update Live Template](/day-two/update-templates) page.
   </Note>

2. **Publish a New Version**  
   Amplication bumps your template version, prompting all dependent resources that inherit from it.  

    <Note>
     Learn about how derived resources receive alerts in our [Automated Alerts](/day-two/automated-alerts) guide.
   </Note>

3. **Merge or Review the Update**  
   Each derived resource receives an automated pull request (or "pending change"). The owning team can review, merge, or further customize these updates without losing their existing custom code.

    <Info>
     See how to handle updates across multiple resources in our [resolve debt across multiple resources](/day-two/resolve-debt-across-multiple-resources) guide.
    </Info>

This dynamic ensures minimal drift across your organization’s resources while still respecting local modifications.

<Check>
By creating **blueprint-based** or **service-based** Live Templates, you establish **golden paths** that unify your technology stack, protect against drift, and empower teams to build swiftly on top of proven patterns. Amplication handles updates and visibility so you can scale with confidence and keep your entire software ecosystem aligned with evolving best practices.
