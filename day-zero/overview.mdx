Amplication's **Day Zero** capabilities empower platform teams to define and govern the foundational elements of their software architecture before a single line of code is written.
This approach ensures consistency, reduces technical debt, and establishes guardrails for development teams operating at scale.

## Why Day Zero Matters for Enterprise Engineering

Modern software ecosystems demand more than just speed - they require strategic control. Without centralized standardization, organizations face:

- Inconsistent service architectures
- Security vulnerabilities from ad-hoc implementations
- Growing maintenance costs from technical drift
- Compliance risks from uneven practices

Amplication's Day Zero solutions directly address these challenges through:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Architectural Governance" icon="shield-check">
    Codify security policies, tech stack requirements, and compliance controls directly into your service foundations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Golden Path Enforcement" icon="road">
    Provide pre-approved development paths that balance standardization with developer autonomy
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise Scalability" icon="arrows-to-dot">
    Manage standards across thousands of services through centralized blueprints and templates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Future-Proof Updates" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Roll out framework updates and security patches across all services simultaneously

## Core Day Zero Capabilities

Amplication provides a comprehensive toolkit for platform engineering teams to establish and maintain organizational standards:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Blueprints" icon="diagram-lean-canvas" href="/day-zero/blueprints">
    **Define reusable architectural templates** for services, infrastructure, and components. Blueprints enforce:
    - Mandatory security configurations
    - Approved technology combinations
    - Standardized relationships between services
    - Organizational metadata requirements
    <Note>
      Learn how to design your architecture with blueprints in our [detailed blueprints guide](/day-zero/blueprints).
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Live Templates" icon="layer-group" href="/day-zero/live-templates">
    **Create auto-updating service foundations** that combine blueprints with specific plugin configurations. Ensure:
    - Consistent starting points for new services
    - Centralized update management
    - Version-controlled standards
    - Compliance with enterprise architecture
    <Note>
      Discover how to establish golden paths for your organization in our [live templates documentation](/day-zero/live-templates).
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Catalog Properties" icon="tags" href="/day-zero/catalog-properties">
    **Establish organizational metadata standards** that enable:
    - Unified resource categorization
    - Cross-service filtering/reporting
    - Automated compliance checks
    - Smart code generation based on metadata
    <Note>
      Define your organizational standards with our [catalog properties guide](/day-zero/catalog-properties).
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Git Sync" icon="code-branch" href="/day-zero/smart-git-sync">
    **Maintain code consistency** across your ecosystem with:
    - Automated PR generation for standards updates
    - Centralized change management
    - Enterprise Git provider support
    - Drift prevention mechanisms
    <Note>
      Set up seamless Git integration with our [Smart Git Sync documentation](/day-zero/smart-git-sync).
