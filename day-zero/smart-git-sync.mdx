**Smart Git Sync** automatically synchronizes changes made between Amplication and your preferred Git repository.
It automatically tracks and commits changes to a dedicated `amplication` branch.
Whether you're adding a new resource or making a change to an existing one, Smart Git Sync ensures that all changes are systematically tracked, committed, and easy to review.

<Tip>
The `amplication` branch should be viewed as your streamlined pipeline for Amplication-driven updates. Let your developers focus on business logic and **Smart Git Sync** will handle the rest.
</Tip>

## How Smart Git Sync Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Central Branch Creation" icon="diagram-project" iconType="solid">
    Amplication establishes an `amplication` branch in each targeted repository. This branch becomes the **single source of truth** for automatically generated code updates, ensuring uniform standards across all services.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Automatic Commit Generation" icon="file-signature" iconType="solid">
    Whenever changes are made in an Amplication project—such as adding a new entity, updating an API endpoint, or modifying configurations—**Smart Git Sync** collects these changes and commits them to the `amplication` branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Pull Request Creation" icon="code-pull-request" iconType="solid">
    If there isn’t an open pull request from `amplication` to your default branch (e.g., `main`), Amplication automatically creates one. The title and message come from the commit description you provide in Amplication’s UI (or from a default template, if none is provided).
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Review & Merge" icon="handshake" iconType="solid">
    Your team merges the PR into the default branch.  
    All organization-wide standards, best practices, or security patches you’ve defined in Amplication are consistently and seamlessly **infused into your codebase** with no manual overhead required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Keep the `amplication` branch intact. Avoid deleting it. If conflicts arise, resolve them **on** the `amplication` branch. This preserves consistency and prevents errors.
</Tip>

## Commit Messages & Visibility

Each commit that **Smart Git Sync** generates contains a clear build message. This message:

- **Identifies** exactly what changed in Amplication.  
- **Links back** to the Amplication build logs so your engineering managers or security auditors can see detailed records of how the code was produced or updated.  
- **Initiates** or updates the associated pull request for easier peer review and consistent merging into the default branch.

<Info>
If you don't provide a custom commit message in the pending changes section, Amplication will automatically generate a default message.
