## Overview: Smart Git Sync

**Smart Git Sync** is Amplication's automated solution for keeping your codebase synchronized with resource changes. It creates a streamlined workflow by:

- Automatically tracking and committing changes to dedicated `amplication` branches
- Managing multiple resources within the same repository through separate branches
- Ensuring systematic tracking of all modifications through clear commit history

<Tip>
Consider the `amplication` branch your dedicated pipeline for automated updates. Your developers can focus on business logic while **Smart Git Sync** manages the infrastructure code.
</Tip>

## The Smart Git Sync Workflow

Our Git synchronization process follows a clear, automated sequence:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Branch Management" icon="diagram-project" iconType="solid">
    Each resource gets its own dedicated branch in your repository. This branch acts as the **single source of truth** for that resource's generated code, ensuring consistent standards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Change Detection" icon="file-signature" iconType="solid">
    Smart Git Sync monitors for changes in your Amplication resources, including:
    - New entity additions
    - API endpoint updates
    - Configuration modifications
    All changes are automatically collected and committed to the appropriate `amplication` branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. PR Automation" icon="code-pull-request" iconType="solid">
    When changes are detected:
    - Checks for existing pull requests from the `amplication` branch
    - Creates a new PR if none exists
    - Uses your provided commit message or generates a descriptive default
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Code Integration" icon="handshake" iconType="solid">
    Your team can then:
    - Review the automated changes
    - Merge the PR into your main codebase
    - Maintain consistent standards across all resources
  </Step>
</Steps>
