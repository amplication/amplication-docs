**Smart Git Sync** automatically synchronizes changes made between Amplication and your preferred Git repository.
It automatically tracks and commits changes to dedicated `amplication` branches.
If multiple resources are connected to the same repository, Amplication manages the changes for each resource in a separate branch.

Whether you're adding a new resource or making a change to an existing one, Smart Git Sync ensures that all changes are systematically tracked, committed, and easy to review.

<Tip>
The `amplication` branch should be viewed as your streamlined pipeline for Amplication-driven updates. Let your developers focus on business logic and **Smart Git Sync** will handle the rest.
</Tip>

## How Smart Git Sync Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Central Branch Creation" icon="diagram-project" iconType="solid">
    Amplication establishes one branch per resource. This branch becomes the **single source of truth** for automatically generated code updates, ensuring uniform standards across all resources.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Automatic Commit Generation" icon="file-signature" iconType="solid">
    Whenever changes are made in an Amplication resource—such as adding a new entity, updating an API endpoint, or modifying configurations—**Smart Git Sync** collects these changes and commits them to the `amplication` branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Pull Request Creation" icon="code-pull-request" iconType="solid">
    If there isn’t an open pull request from `amplication` to your default branch (e.g., `main`), Amplication automatically creates one. The title and message come from the commit description you provide in Amplication’s UI (or from a default template, if none is provided).
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Review & Merge" icon="handshake" iconType="solid">
    Your team merges the PR into the base branch.  
    All organization-wide standards, best practices, or security patches you’ve defined in Amplication are consistently and seamlessly **infused into your codebase** with no manual overhead required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Besides the above git providers, Amplication can work with any git provider whether it's online or on-premises.

## Commit Messages & Visibility

Each commit that **Smart Git Sync** generates contains a clear build message. This message:

- **Identifies** exactly what changed in Amplication.  
- **Links back** to the Amplication build logs so your engineering managers or security auditors can see detailed records of how the code was produced or updated.  
- **Initiates** or updates the associated pull request for easier peer review and consistent merging into the default branch.

<Info>
If you don't provide a custom commit message in the pending changes section, Amplication will automatically generate a default message.
</Info>

## Update Base Branch

By default Amplication uses the repository default branch as the base branch for the Pull Request.
You can change this by settings the "Git Base Branch" in the **Git Settings** section.

For example, if you want to merge Amplication's changes into the `develop` branch instead of `main` you can update the value of the field to `develop`.

## Next Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Git Provider">
    Amplication supports [GitHub](/sync-with-github), [GitLab](/sync-with-gitlab), [Bitbucket](/sync-with-bitbucket), [Azure DevOps](/day-zero/sync-with-azure-devops), and [AWS CodeCommit](/sync-with-aws-codecommit).
    Pick your primary provider to start integrating Smart Git Sync.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automate and Monitor">
    Once Smart Git Sync is active, monitor pull requests and merges in the `amplication` branch. Over time, you’ll see significantly less fragmentation, manual rework, and wasted developer hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale Confidently">
    Whether you have 5 services or 500, Amplication’s Git Sync approach scales. As your engineering organization grows, your foundational code remains **consistent**, **secure**, and **in sync**.
