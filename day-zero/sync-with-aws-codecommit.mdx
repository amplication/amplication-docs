Amplication integrates with **AWS CodeCommit**, a secure, highly scalable, managed source control service that hosts private Git repositories within the AWS cloud.
By connecting Amplication to AWS CodeCommit, you establish a robust, centralized system for managing your all your resources.

## Pre-requisites

To enable Amplication to interact with your AWS CodeCommit repositories, it's necessary to configure the appropriate AWS credentials.
This involves providing Amplication with:

- **AWS Region**: Specify the AWS region where your CodeCommit repositories are located.
- **AWS HTTPS Git Credentials**: Configure HTTPS Git credentials for the `amplication[bot]` user, allowing secure interaction with your CodeCommit repositories. Refer to [AWS documentation on setting up Git credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html) for detailed instructions.
- **AWS Access Keys**: Provide AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for an IAM user with `AWSCodeCommitPowerUser` managed policy. This grants Amplication the necessary permissions to manage repositories, create commits, and open pull requests on your behalf.

Once these prerequisites are configured and provided to Amplication, you will be able to select an existing CodeCommit repository or create a new one when setting up Git sync for your services.

<Note>
Please [contact Amplication](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/yuval-hazaz) to provide your AWS credentials and region information before attempting to connect your AWS CodeCommit account.
This ensures proper configuration and seamless integration with your AWS environment.

## Working with Pull Requests

Amplication automates code updates to your AWS CodeCommit repositories through pull requests.
When you generate code or make changes to your services in Amplication, the system automatically prepares and pushes these changes to your designated CodeCommit repository.

If a pull request for the current changes does not exist, Amplication will create a new pull request from the `amplication` branch to your repository's default branch (e.g., `main`).
This ensures a consistent and controlled process for reviewing and merging updates into your main codebase.
