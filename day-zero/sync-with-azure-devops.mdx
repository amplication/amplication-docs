Amplication offers robust integration with **Azure DevOps**, Microsoft's comprehensive suite for version control, agile planning, and continuous delivery.
This integration is designed for platform teams operating within a Microsoft-centric environment, enabling them to enforce standardization and governance across all services. By connecting Amplication to your Azure DevOps organization, you establish a centralized platform for managing service blueprints and automate code synchronization, effectively minimizing inconsistencies and technical debt across your projects.

## Connect Your Azure DevOps Organization

Connecting your Azure DevOps organization to Amplication is the initial step toward establishing a standardized and governed software foundation. Follow these steps to set up the integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Amplication Workspace">
    Sign in to your Amplication account and navigate to your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to 'Projects' Tab">
    Locate and select the 'Projects' tab from the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Project and Access 'Software Catalog'">
    Select the specific project you wish to configure and proceed to its 'Software Catalog' to manage your services and resources.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open 'Git Settings' Tab">
    Within the Software Catalog, find and click on the **Git Settings** tab. If a repository is already connected, you will see a **Change Repository** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Git Organization">
    Click **Change Repository** (if necessary) and then select **Select Git Organization** to connect to your Azure DevOps organization.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Specify Organization Name">
    If you are using multiple organizations in Azure DevOps, you'll be asked to provide the specific organization name you wish to connect. If you use a single organization, you can leave this field empty.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authorization and Repository Selection

Upon initiating the connection to Azure DevOps, Amplication requires authorization to access your projects and repositories. This ensures secure and automated synchronization of your service foundations.

During the authorization process, you will be guided to grant Amplication the necessary permissions within your Azure DevOps environment. Once authorized, you can choose to either utilize an existing Azure DevOps repository or create a new one to house the code generated by Amplication. This flexibility allows you to integrate Amplication seamlessly with both new and existing projects, ensuring consistent standards across your development lifecycle.

## Working with Merge Requests

With Azure DevOps integration active, Amplication streamlines the process of keeping your service foundations aligned with organizational standards.

When you implement changes within Amplication like adding new features, updating configurations, or refining APIs, these updates are automatically prepared for synchronization with your Azure DevOps repository.
Amplication compiles these changes into commits on a dedicated `amplication` branch.
If a merge request is not already in place, Amplication automatically generates a new **merge request** from the `amplication` branch to your specified base branch (like `main` or `develop`).
This automated merge request process facilitates efficient code review and ensures that all updates are systematically integrated into your codebase.
