Amplication seamlessly integrates with **Bitbucket**, Atlassian's platform for code collaboration.
By connecting Amplication to your Bitbucket workspace, you automate the synchronization of updates using [Smart Git Sync](/day-zero/smart-git-sync/), significantly reducing code drift and the accumulation of technical debt.

## Connect Your Bitbucket Workspace

Begin by linking your Bitbucket workspace to Amplication.
This connection allows Amplication to manage repositories, branches, and pull requests directly within your Bitbucket environment, streamlining your workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Amplication Workspace">
    Access your workspace within the Amplication platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the 'Projects' Tab">
    Find and select the "Projects" tab in the navigation bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a specific project's 'Software Catalog'">
    Click on your desired project to access its Software Catalog, where you can manage all services and resources.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the 'Git Settings' Tab">
    Select the **Git Settings** tab. If a repository is already connected, click **Change Repository**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Git Organization">
    After clicking "Change Repository", select "Select Git Organization" to choose a new Bitbucket workspace for your repository.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authorization and Repository Selection

When you choose to integrate with Bitbucket, Amplication will request necessary permissions to access and manage your repositories. This ensures automated, consistent synchronization across your organization's codebase.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorize Amplication's Bitbucket Integration">
    You’ll be redirected to Bitbucket to authorize Amplication to access your workspace. Grant the necessary permissions to enable seamless integration.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose or Create a Repository">
    Once your workspace is selected, configure your repository:

      <Card title="Use Existing Repository" icon="book" iconType="solid">
        Select an existing repository from your Bitbucket workspace to connect to Amplication.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Create a New Repository" icon="plus" iconType="solid">
        Create a new Bitbucket repository directly through Amplication to house your generated code.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    <Frame caption="Select your repository">

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can connect multiple Bitbucket workspaces if your organization uses more than one. Simply repeat the steps above for each workspace you need to integrate.
</Tip>

## Working with Pull Requests

Any changes you make to your resources within Amplication, such as adding a new entity, modifying configurations, or updating API endpoints, are automatically compiled into commits on a dedicated `amplication` branch.
If a pull request is not already open, Amplication will automatically generate a new **pull request** from the `amplication` branch to your designated base branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Update your resource in Amplication, whether it's adjusting service settings, adding entities, or refining API specifications.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Code">
    1. Access the pending changes sidebar in your [Service Catalog](/day-two/software-catalog/).
    2. Click "Generate the code" to initiate the build process and prepare the code changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To learn how to update the base branch, visit the [Smart Git Sync](/day-zero/smart-git-sync/) page.
