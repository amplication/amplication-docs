Amplication seamlessly integrates with **GitHub**.
This integration lets platform teams establish a single source of truth for all resources, ensuring consistency and governance across the entire organization.
By connecting Amplication to your GitHub organization, you automate the synchronization of updates and minimize drift and technical debt.

## Connect Your GitHub Organization

To begin, link your GitHub account or organization within Amplication.
This lets Amplication create repositories, branches, and pull requests (PRs) on your behalf.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings for Amplication's GitHub App">
    After selecting your preferred account or organization, you'll be led to the configuration page.
    You can configure the GitHub App to only allow access specific repositories in your account, or allow Amplication to access all of your repositories.

</Tip>

## Working with Pull Requests

Any updates made to your Amplication resources, like adding an entity, adjusting settings, or altering roles are automatically compiled into commits on the dedicated `amplication` branch.
If no open PR exists, Amplication will generate a new **pull request** to your specified base branch (.e.g. `main` or `develop`).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Update your resource in Amplication like editing settings, adding an entity, or updating an API endpoint.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Code">
    1. Access the pending changes sidebar in your [Software Catalog](/day-two/software-catalog/).
    2. Click "Generate the code" to initiate the build process
  </Step>
</Steps>
