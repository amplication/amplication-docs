Generate a complete codebase using Amplication's opinionated standards for Node.js or .NET development.
You can customize every aspect of the generated code to fit your existing software ecosystem, or use it as a foundation if you haven't established your own standards yet.

Service resources use Amplication's best-in-class Node.js and .NET code generation engine to produce human-readable, best-practice code.
If you're comfortable with Node.js or .NET, or need to spin up a backend quickly, creating a service is a great fit.

<Note>
  **Amplication's Standards vs Custom Standards**: Amplication opinionated
  services are based on pre-configured templates and technologies in .NET or
  Node.js, configurable through our various plugins available out of the box.
  You can use Amplication's built-in standards for rapid development or [define
  your own standards](/day-zero/amplication-standards-vs-custom-standards)
</Note>

## Tech Stack Options

Amplication maintains production-ready code generation engines for both Node.js and .NET.
Our plugin-based architecture ensures maximum flexibility, allowing you to customize every aspect of your service.
With dozens of plugins available in our public catalog, you can easily adapt the generated code to match your preferences.
