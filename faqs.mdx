Here are some of the most common questions we receive about Amplication. If you don't find the answer you're looking for, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://amplication.com/discord) or [contact our team](https://amplication.com/contact-us) directly.

<Accordion title="What's the difference between Blueprints and Plugins?">
Blueprints are like architectural drawings that define what you want to build - they specify the type of resource, its properties, and relationships with other blueprints. Think of them as templates that standardize what you build across your organization.

Plugins, on the other hand, contain the actual code that determines how those specifications are implemented. They handle the concrete details like code generation, infrastructure setup, and deployment processes. You need both: Blueprints for standardization and Plugins for implementation.

<Accordion title="When should I use custom Blueprints vs. Amplication's standard Blueprints?">
Amplication offers their own standards through Node.js and .NET. They are ideal if you quickly want to adopt industry best practices and leverage Amplication's public plugin ecosystem. They offer faster onboarding and immediate access to proven patterns.

Custom Blueprints are better when you have specific organizational requirements, technology mandates, or unique compliance needs. They offer you complete control of your service architecture but require more initial setup.

<Accordion title="What happens to existing resources when I update a Blueprint?">
Blueprint updates are not automatically propagated to existing resources - this is intentional to prevent unexpected disruptions. When you update a Blueprint, you'll need to manually apply these changes to each affected resource through Amplication's interface.

The update process involves reviewing changes, updating configurations, and regenerating code, which creates Pull Requests for your review.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are resources impacted when Plugins are updated?">
When you publish a new Plugin version, Amplication automatically triggers Technical Debt alerts for all affected resources. These alerts appear in the Technical Debt tab for each resource, showing exactly what changes the new Plugin version introduces.

Users can review changes through a diff view and choose when to apply the updates. The process generates Pull Requests that can be reviewed and merged according to your team's workflow.

<Accordion title="How can I see which resources depend on a specific Blueprint?">
For Blueprints, you can use the "View Resources" feature in the Blueprints section to see all resources created from a specific Blueprint. This filters the Workspace Catalog to show only relevant resources.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get notified about Blueprint or Plugin updates affecting my resources?">
Plugin updates trigger automatic Technical Debt alerts visible through in-app notifications and the Technical Debt tab for affected resources. These notifications are targeted to relevant team members and provide direct access to review and apply updates.
