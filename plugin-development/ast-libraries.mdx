# Amplication AST Libraries

<Note>
These AST libraries are used by Blueprint and .NET engines. Node.js plugins use different methods for code generation as detailed in the Node.js Plugin Events documentation.
</Note>

Amplication AST libraries provide functionality for generating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for different programming languages in the Amplication platform. These libraries are used to generate type-safe, well-structured code for various programming languages.

## Key Features

* Type-safe AST generation
* Support for multiple programming languages
* Common interfaces and types across language implementations
* Extensible architecture for adding new language support

## Available Libraries

Amplication provides several AST libraries:

- [AST Types](/plugin-development/ast-types) - Common interfaces and types used across different language implementations
- [C# AST](/plugin-development/csharp-ast) - Library for generating C# code through an abstract syntax tree
- [Java AST](/plugin-development/java-ast) - Library for generating Java code through an abstract syntax tree

## Installation

To install the libraries:

```bash
# For AST Types
npm install @amplication/ast-types

# For C# AST
npm install @amplication/csharp-ast

# For Java AST
npm install @amplication/java-ast
```

## Getting Started

To use these libraries in your project:

```typescript
// For Java AST
import { Class, Interface, Method } from '@amplication/java-ast';

// or for C# AST
import { Class, Interface, Method } from '@amplication/csharp-ast';
```

## Using AST Libraries in Plugins

Amplication's plugin architecture is built around the AST libraries. When developing plugins, you can leverage these libraries to generate code that integrates seamlessly with Amplication's code generation process.

### Plugin Integration

All Amplication plugins work with objects of type `IAstNode` from the AST libraries. Plugins typically:

1. Create AST nodes using the appropriate library (Java, C#, etc.)
2. Create an `IFile<IAstNode>` object that references the AST node
3. Add the file to the context using `context.files.set()`

This approach allows plugins to generate code that's properly integrated into Amplication's code generation pipeline.

### Example: Using AST in a Plugin

Here's an example of how a plugin might use the Java AST library to create a class:

```typescript
import { IAstNode } from "@amplication/ast-types";
import {
  blueprintPluginEventsParams as blueprint,
  blueprintPluginEventsTypes,
  blueprintTypes,
  IFile,
} from "@amplication/code-gen-types";
import {
  Access,
  Class,
  Field,
  Method,
  MethodType,
  Type,
} from "@amplication/java-ast";
import { pascalCase } from "pascal-case";

class JavaTestPlugin implements blueprintTypes.AmplicationPlugin {
  register(): blueprintPluginEventsTypes.BlueprintEvents {
    return {
      createBlueprint: {
        before: this.beforeCreateBlueprint,
      },
    };
  }
  async beforeCreateBlueprint(
    context: blueprintTypes.DsgContext,
    eventParams: blueprint.CreateBlueprintParams,
  ): Promise<blueprint.CreateBlueprintParams> {
    context.logger.info("Generating Java test classes...");

    const params = {} as Record<string, string>;

    params.SERVICE_DISPLAY_NAME = context.resourceInfo?.name || "User";
    params.SERVICE_NAME = pascalCase(params.SERVICE_DISPLAY_NAME);

    const testClass = new Class({
      name: "MyJavaTestClass",
      packageName: "com.example.test",
      access: Access.Public,
    });

    testClass.addField(
      new Field({
        name: "myMockField",
        type: Type.string(),
        access: Access.Private,
      }),
    );

    testClass.addField(
      new Field({
        name: "myServiceField",
        type: Type.string(),
        access: Access.Private,
      }),
    );

    testClass.addMethod(
      new Method({
        name: "myTestMethod1",
        type: MethodType.INSTANCE,
        access: Access.Public,
      }),
    );

    testClass.addMethod(
      new Method({
        name: "myTestMethod2",
        type: MethodType.INSTANCE,
        access: Access.Public,
      }),
    );

    const javaFile: IFile<IAstNode> = {
      path: "MyJavaTestClass.java",
      code: testClass,
    };

    context.files.set(javaFile);

    return eventParams;
  }
}

export default JavaTestPlugin;

```

Using the AST libraries gives you fine-grained control over code generation while ensuring the generated code integrates correctly with the rest of the Amplication-generated codebase.
