Amplication plugins offer powerful **lifecycle functions** that allow you to customize and extend the code generation process precisely where you need it.
Every event within Amplication's plugin system exposes these lifecycle functions, giving you consistent control throughout the resource generation process.

## Event Structure

Each event in Amplication's plugin system follows a predictable structure, offering both `before` and `after` hooks:

```tsx
export interface PluginEventType<T extends EventParams> {
  before?: PluginBeforeEvent<T>;
  after?: PluginAfterEvent<T>;
}
```

* **`before`**:  This function executes **before** Amplication emits the main event logic. Use it to modify event parameters and tailor the default behavior *before* it happens.
* **`after`**: This function executes **after** Amplication's core event logic. It provides access to the generated modules or files, allowing you to apply transformations, add custom logic, or restructure outputs.

Each event defines its specific `EventParams` interface (`T extends EventParams`), providing you with type-safe access to the relevant data for that particular stage of the generation process.

```tsx
export interface EventParams {}
```

## Function Signatures

Let's examine the signatures of the `before` and `after` functions to understand how you can interact with Amplication's code generation:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js Plugins">

```tsx
export type PluginBeforeEvent<T extends EventParams> = (
  dsgContext: DsgContext,
  eventParams: T
) => Promisable<T>;

export type PluginAfterEvent<T extends EventParams> = (
  dsgContext: DsgContext,
  eventParams: T,
  modules: ModuleMap
) => Promisable<ModuleMap>;
```

</Tab>
<Tab title=".NET Plugins">

```tsx
export type PluginBeforeEvent<T extends EventParams> = (
  dsgContext: DsgContext,
  eventParams: T
) => Promisable<T>;

export type PluginAfterEvent<T extends EventParams, F> = (
  dsgContext: DsgContext,
  eventParams: T,
  files: FileMap<F>
) => Promisable<FileMap<F>>;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Parameters:**

<ResponseField name="dsgContext" type="DsgContext">
  The Design Context provides access to shared information and utilities across all events within a plugin execution. Use it to retrieve configuration, access the service schema, and more.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="eventParams" type="T extends EventParams">
  These are the parameters specific to the event being handled. The type `T` is defined by the specific event interface, giving you access to relevant data points to influence the generation.
</ResponseField>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js Plugins">
<ResponseField name="modules" type="ModuleMap">
  A `ModuleMap` is a structure containing the generated code modules as key-value pairs, where keys are module paths and values are the code content. This is your entry point to modify the generated code in Node.js plugins.
</ResponseField>
</Tab>
<Tab title=".NET Plugins">
<ResponseField name="files" type="FileMap<F>">
  Similar to `ModuleMap`, `FileMap` is used in .NET plugins to represent generated files. It provides a way to access and modify the generated files before they are written to disk.
</ResponseField>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Node.js plugins**, the `after` function works with a [`ModuleMap`](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/libs/util/code-gen-types/src/code-gen-types.ts#L149), representing code as modules.
**.NET plugins**, the `after` function uses a [`FileMap`](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/libs/util/code-gen-types/src/files/file-map.ts), which is designed for file-based manipulations.
</Note>

**Return Values:**

<ResponseField name="before function" type="Promisable<T>">
  The `before` function should return a `Promise` that resolves to the (potentially modified) `eventParams`. Returning the modified `eventParams` allows you to influence the subsequent default behavior of the event.
</ResponseField>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js Plugins">
<ResponseField name="after function" type="Promisable<ModuleMap>">
  The `after` function should return a `Promise` resolving to the (potentially modified) `ModuleMap`. Returning the modified `ModuleMap` ensures your changes are incorporated into the final generated output.
</ResponseField>
</Tab>
<Tab title=".NET Plugins">
<ResponseField name="after function" type="Promisable<FileMap<F>>">
  Similarly, the .NET `after` function should return a `Promise` resolving to the modified `FileMap<F>`.
</ResponseField>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Practical Use: Modifying Generated Files in `after` Functions

A common use case for `after` functions is to restructure the generated files. Imagine you need to enforce a specific folder structure for all your organization's services. The `after` function is the perfect place to achieve this.

For example, you might want to:

*   Move all generated GraphQL resolvers into a dedicated `resolvers` directory.
*   Organize entity-related files into entity-specific subfolders.
*   Add custom documentation or README files to specific directories.

The `after` function gives you the flexibility to manipulate the generated `ModuleMap` or `FileMap` and reorganize files as needed to meet your project's architectural requirements.

## Explore Real-World Examples

The best way to understand the power of `before` and `after` functions is to see them in action.

We encourage you to dive into the [code of Amplication's official plugins](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins). These plugins are built using the same plugin framework and provide numerous practical examples of how to implement `before` and `after` lifecycle functions for various customization tasks.

By exploring these examples, you can gain insights into:

*   Modifying code templates to inject custom logic.
*   Adding new files and modules to the generated output.
*   Integrating with external services and APIs during generation.
*   Enforcing coding standards and best practices through automated modifications.

## Best Practices and Important Considerations

To ensure your plugins are robust and maintainable, keep these best practices in mind when working with `before` and `after` functions:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Targeted Modifications in `after` Functions" icon="edit">
In `after` functions, focus on making **specific, targeted changes** to the generated files. Avoid wholesale replacement of entire files unless absolutely necessary. Smaller, incremental modifications are easier to understand, maintain, and less likely to introduce unintended side effects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Careful Template Adjustments in `before` Functions" icon="exclamation-triangle" iconType="solid">
When modifying templates within `before` functions, exercise caution. Changes to templates can have a broad impact on code generation. Ensure you thoroughly test any template modifications to prevent unintended consequences or breakages in the generated code.
