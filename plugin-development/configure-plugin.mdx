After you've added your plugin to the plugin repository in Amplication, you have access to a few configuration options.
They are key to making your plugin easily discoverable in the UI, relevant to your projects, and smoothly integrated into your existing workflows.

## Configuration Options

The following options allow you to configure how your plugin appears and functions within Amplication:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Display Name" icon="pen-fancy">
    <p>
      By default, the display name of your plugin is the same as its Plugin ID. However, you can customize this to make it more user-friendly and descriptive within the Amplication UI.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear and concise display name helps your teammates quickly understand the plugin's purpose and functionality when browsing available plugins.
    </p>
    <Tip>
      Choose a display name that is intuitive and easily understood by your team. For example, instead of a generic ID like <code>my-auth-plugin</code>, consider a display name like "Organization Standard Authentication".
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Icon & Color" icon="palette">
    <p>
      Amplication provides a library of icons and color palettes to visually represent your plugins. Choosing a custom icon and color makes your plugins stand out in the UI and enhances visual recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visual distinction is especially helpful when you have multiple plugins in your organization's repository. A recognizable icon can significantly speed up plugin discovery and selection.
    </p>
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Code Generator" icon="code">
    <p>
      The Code Generator option determines which code generator the plugin is built for (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Blueprints). This option dictates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plugin Compatibility:</strong> A plugin built for Node.js will only be available for Node.js based resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Plugin Events:</strong> Each code generator exposes a specific set of <Tooltip tip="Plugin events are lifecycle hooks within Amplication that allow plugins to modify the code generation process at various stages.">plugin events</Tooltip>.</li>
    </ul>
    <Note>
      To learn more about available plugin events, see the Plugin Events reference documentation for your selected code generator.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Description" icon="info">
    <p>
      The description appears in the Amplication UI and provides valuable context to your developers. A well-written description should clearly explain:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The plugin's purpose and functionality</li>
      <li>The problems it solves or the enhancements it provides</li>
      <li>Any specific use cases or requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Versions" icon="code-branch">
    <p>
      The Versions section allows you to manage different iterations of your plugin. This is crucial for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Publishing new versions as you improve your plugin</li>
      <li>Controlled updates via Pull Requests when new versions are available</li>
      <li>Maintaining consistency across all services in your organization</li>
    </ul>
    <Note>
      To learn more about plugin versioning, see the [Publish a Plugin](/plugin-development/publish-a-plugin) guide.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dev Version" icon="wrench">
    <p>
      When enabled, Dev Version allows Amplication to pull the plugin code directly from the base branch (e.g., <code>main</code>, <code>develop</code>) defined in your Git settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option streamlines plugin testing during development by avoiding the formal plugin publishing process, allowing for quicker iterations and experimentation.
    </p>
    <Note>
      To learn more about testing plugins during development, see the [Test a Plugin](/plugin-development/test-a-plugin) guide.
