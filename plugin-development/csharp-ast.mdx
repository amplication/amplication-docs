# C# AST Library

<Note>
The C# AST library is used by Blueprint and .NET engine plugins. Node.js plugins use different methods for code generation as detailed in the Node.js Plugin Events documentation.
</Note>

The C# AST library provides functionality for generating C# code through an abstract syntax tree in the Amplication platform. It enables the creation of type-safe, well-structured C# code for .NET applications.

## Key Features

* Class and interface generation
* Method and property declarations
* Type system with generics
* Attributes and documentation
* Namespace management

## Scope and Purpose

The C# AST library is not intended to cover all C# language functionality. Instead, it focuses on the elements needed to create foundation and boilerplate code with Amplication plugins. The library provides building blocks for generating well-structured C# code for common patterns and use cases.

When more specialized or custom code is needed, the `CodeBlock` class can be used as a generic node that can include any code as a string:

```typescript
import { CodeBlock } from '@amplication/csharp-ast';

// Create a custom code block for specialized logic
const customLogic = new CodeBlock(`
  // Custom C# implementation
  using (var client = new HttpClient())
  {
    var response = await client.GetAsync(endpoint);
    return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
  }
`);

// Add to your class or method
```

This flexibility allows you to generate both structured AST-based code and custom code blocks when necessary.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @amplication/csharp-ast
```

## Usage

The C# AST library allows you to build C# code programmatically:

```typescript
import { Class, ClassReference, CodeBlock } from "@amplication/csharp-ast";

// Create a class
const myClass = new Class({
    name: "MyService",
    access: "public",
    namespace: "MyNamespace",
    interfaceReferences: [
    new ClassReference({
        name: "IMyService",
        namespace: "MyNamespace",
    }),
    ],
});

// Add methods and properties
// ...
```
