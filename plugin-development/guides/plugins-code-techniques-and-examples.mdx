Amplication plugins allow developers to extend and customize the code generation process. This guide provides detailed explanations and practical code examples to help you build plugins effectively.

## Reading Resource Information and Properties

Plugins often need to access resource metadata, such as entity definitions, properties, and settings.
All the data is available throught the `context` object

<CodeResourceInfo />

## Copy the content of a folder and replace placeholders

Plugins can generate files dynamically by using placeholders in static template files.

The function `importStaticFilesWithReplacements` or `importStaticFiles` from `context.utils` can be used to load an entire content of a folder into the generated code.

<FunctionReferenceImportStaticFiles/>
<FunctionReferenceImportStaticFilesWithReplacements/>
<CodeCopyStaticFiles />

## Reading Relations Data and Related Resources

Entities in Amplication can have relationships. Accessing these relationships is crucial for generating correct code.

<CodeRelatedResources/>


## Reading Plugin Settings

Plugins can define configurable settings that affect how they function.

<CodePluginSettings/>


## Finding an Existing File in the Context

When modifying generated code, itâ€™s important to locate existing files.

<CodeGetFile/>

## Adding a File into the Context

A plugin may need to generate and add new files.

**Example:** Creating and adding a new file.

```typescript
// Placeholder for code example
```

## Replacing a File in the Context

Replacing an existing file ensures customization while preserving structure.

**Example:** Overwriting a generated file.

```typescript
// Placeholder for code example
```

## Removing a File from the Context

In some cases, plugins may need to exclude files from the final output.

**Example:** Deleting a file from the generation context.

```typescript
// Placeholder for code example
```

## Conclusion

With these techniques, you can create powerful Amplication plugins that customize and enhance generated applications. Use the placeholders to add your implementation-specific code examples.
