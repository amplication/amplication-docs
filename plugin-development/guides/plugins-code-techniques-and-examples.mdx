Amplication plugins allow developers to extend and customize the code generation process. This guide provides detailed explanations and practical code examples to help you build plugins effectively.

## Reading Resource Information and Properties

Plugins often need to access resource metadata, such as entity definitions, properties, and settings.
All the data is available throught the `context` object

<CodeResourceInfo />

## Copy the content of a folder and replace placeholders

Plugins can generate files dynamically by using placeholders in static template files.

The function `importStaticFilesWithReplacements` or `importStaticFiles` from `context.utils` can be used to load an entire content of a folder into the generated code.

## Reading Relations Data and Related Resources

Entities in Amplication can have relationships. Accessing these relationships is crucial for generating correct code.

<CodeRelatedResources/>


## Reading Plugin Settings

Plugins can define configurable settings that affect how they function.

## Using the FileMap class to manage files

The `FileMap` class is a utility class that helps manage files in the context.
it is a map of files that can be used to replace, add, remove or get files from the context.
