## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1. An Amplication workspace with a project that is connected to a Git organization and has a plugin repository configured as explained [here](/plugin-development/plugin-folder-structure).

---

## Download and Register the "Blueprint Plugin Template" Plugin

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the Plugin Template">
Download the Amplication **Blueprint Plugin Template**, which provides the foundational structure for plugin development.

You can find the template in the official Amplication plugins repository:  
[Blueprint Plugin Template Repository](https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/blueprint-plugins/blueprint-plugin-template).

To download the folder, use the [GitHub Directory Downloader](https://download-directory.github.io/) or download it directly:  
[Download Plugin Template](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Famplication%2Fplugins%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fblueprint-plugins%2Fblueprint-plugin-template).

</Step>

<Step title="Copy the Template into the Plugin Repository">
  After downloading the ZIP file, extract its contents and copy them into your
  plugin repository under a folder named **`blueprint-plugin-template`**.

</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Commit and Push the Changes">
Commit the copied template files to Git and push them to the repository:

```sh
git add blueprint-plugin-template
git commit -m "Added blueprint plugin template"
git push origin main
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create a New Blueprint in Amplication">
  In **Amplication**, create a new blueprint named **"Amplication Plugin"**.
  This blueprint will serve as a foundation for generating new plugins.
</Step>

<Step title="Register the Plugin in the Private Plugins List">
Register the newly created plugin in the private plugins list and associate it with the **"Amplication Plugin"** blueprint.

Then, either add a [new version](/plugin-development/publish-a-plugin#step-1-add-a-new-plugin-version-in-amplication) of the plugin, or enable the `@dev` version - and publish the plugin.

</Step>
</Steps>

  `Amplication Plugin` blueprint that includes the `Blueprint Plugin Template`
  plugin.
</Note>
