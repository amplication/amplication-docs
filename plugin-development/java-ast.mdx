# Java AST Library

The Java AST library provides functionality for generating Java code through an abstract syntax tree in the Amplication platform. It enables the creation of type-safe, well-structured Java code.

## Key Features

* Class and interface generation
* Method and field declarations
* Type system with generics
* Annotations and documentation
* Package management

## Installation

```bash
npm install @amplication/java-ast
```

## Usage

The Java AST library allows you to build Java code programmatically:

```typescript
import { 
  Class, 
  ClassReference,
  Method, 
  Field 
} from '@amplication/java-ast';

// Create a class
const myClass = new Class({
    name: "MyService",
    packageName: "com.example.service",
    access: Access.Public,
    implements_: [
    new ClassReference({
        name: "IMyService",
        packageName: "com.example.service",
    }),
    ],
});

// Add methods and fields
// ...
```
