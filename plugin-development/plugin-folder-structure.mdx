Private plugins in Amplication live in your own Git repository with a specific folder structure.
Each plugin requires its own folder within a designated `plugins` directory, allowing Amplication to detect and manage your organization's private plugins.

## Step 1: Create Your Private Plugins Git Repository

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a New Git Repository">
Create a new, empty Git repository dedicated to housing your private plugins.
</Step>

<Step title="Create the plugins Folder">
In the root of your repository, create a folder named `plugins`.
This folder will contain all your individual private plugin folders.

```
your-plugins-repo/
â””â”€â”€ plugins/
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Amplication detects available plugins by searching for individual folders within the `plugins` directory. Each plugin folder name serves as the plugin's unique identifier and must use kebab-case (e.g., `company-auth-plugin`). This folder structure is required for Amplication to recognize and add your plugins to the UI.
</Note>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Plugin Folder

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js Plugin">
Clone the official template into your plugins directory:

```bash
cd plugins
git clone https://github.com/amplication/plugin-template your-plugin-id
```

Replace `your-plugin-id` with your chosen plugin identifier (e.g., `company-auth-plugin`).

<Note>
This command clones our [official Node.js plugin template](https://github.com/amplication/plugin-template), which is the recommended starting point for creating Node.js plugins.
</Note>

Before commiting & pushing your new plugin to git, you need to build the plugin's assets:

```bash
cd `your-plugin-id`
npm install & npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Here we go! ðŸš€"
git push
```

</Tab>

<Tab title=".NET Plugin">
Use sparse checkout to copy the .NET Postgres Database plugin as a template:

```bash
cd plugins
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/amplication/plugins
git sparse-checkout set plugins/dotnet-db-postgres
git checkout
mv plugins/dotnet-db-postgres your-plugin-id
```

Replace `your-plugin-id` with your chosen plugin identifier.

<Note>
While we don't yet have an official .NET plugin template, we recommend using our existing .NET Postgres Database plugin as a starting point. This plugin provides a solid foundation and examples of .NET-specific implementations that you can modify for your needs.

## Step 3: Connect Your Repository in Amplication

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Plugin Repository">
Navigate to your project and click on **Plugin Repository** in the Platform Console.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Git Settings">
1. Click on **Git Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Enable the **Override default settings** toggle
3. Select your dedicated plugin repository from the dropdown menu
</Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

<Warning>
Don't use the same Git repository for your private plugins and your generated services. This can lead to conflicts and unexpected issues during the build process.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Add Your Plugin in Amplication

When you click the **Add Plugin** button in the Plugin Repository tab, Amplication will automatically scan for new plugins in your connected repository's `plugins` directory. The system will display any newly detected plugins that haven't been added to your project yet.

If no new plugins are found, you'll see a "No new plugins found in the repository" message. Ensure your plugin folder is properly created and named before attempting to add it.
