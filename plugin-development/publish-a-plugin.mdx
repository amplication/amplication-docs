After you've thoroughly developed and tested your private plugin using [Dev Versions](/plugin-development/test-a-plugin), it's time to **publish** it.
Publishing makes your plugin version officially available for use across your organization's Amplication resources and templates.

## Why Publish Plugin Versions?

Publishing plugin versions is crucial for maintaining control and stability in your Amplication environment. It allows you to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Establish Stable Releases">
    Publishing creates distinct, versioned releases of your plugin. This ensures that when teams use your plugin, they are leveraging a known, tested, and stable version.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Control Updates and Changes">
    By publishing specific versions, you prevent unintended breaking changes from your ongoing development from immediately impacting services using your plugin. Teams can choose when to update to newer published versions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Think of publishing plugin versions as creating official releases of your plugin functionality.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Disable Dev Versions

Before you can publish a version, you need to disable Dev Versions for your plugin. This ensures that you are publishing a stable version based on a specific point in your codebase, not the potentially changing code in your development branch.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Private Plugins">
Go to your project's **Platform Console** from the top header and click on the **Private Plugins** tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Your Plugin">
Choose the private plugin you intend to publish from the list.
</Step>
<Step title="Disable Dev Version Toggle">
In your plugin's settings, locate the **Enable Dev Version** toggle and switch it to the **off** state.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Add a New Plugin Version in Amplication

Next, you'll add a new version entry for your plugin within the Amplication Platform Console. This version will correspond to a specific tag in your Git repository in the next step.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Private Plugins">
Ensure you are in the **Private Plugins** tab in your Platform Console and have selected your plugin.
</Step>
<Step title="Scroll to 'Add New Version'">
Scroll down to the **Add New Version** section.
</Step>
<Step title="Click 'Add Version'">
Click the **Add Version** button.
</Step>
<Step title="Note the Version Number">
Amplication will prompt you to enter a version number (e.g., `0.1.0`). Choose a semantic version that accurately reflects the changes in this release. **Make sure to note down this version number**, as you'll need it for the next step.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Tag Your Git Repository with the Version

Now, you need to tag your plugin's Git repository to associate a specific commit with the version you just added in Amplication. Amplication uses these tags to identify plugin versions during code generation.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Your Plugin's Local Repository">
Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your private plugin's Git repository.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a Git Tag">
Use the `git tag` command to create a tag. The tag format **must** be: `your-plugin-id@version-number`. Replace `your-plugin-id` with your actual Plugin ID (the folder name of your plugin) and `version-number` with the version you noted in the previous step (e.g., `0.1.0`).

```bash
git tag "your-plugin-id@0.1.0"
```
</Step>
<Step title="Push the Tag to Your Remote Repository">
Push the newly created tag to your remote Git repository using the `git push` command, specifying the tag name.

```bash
git push origin "your-plugin-id@0.1.0"
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Tagging is crucial.**  Ensure you use the correct tag format (`your-plugin-id@version-number`) and push the tag to your remote repository. Amplication relies on these tags to correctly identify and fetch the plugin code for each version.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Publish the Plugin Version in Amplication

Finally, you need to publish the version through the Amplication Platform Console to make it officially available.

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Platform Console Changes">
Navigate to your project's **Platform Console**.
</Step>
<Step title="Click 'Publish New Version'">
In the Platform Changes sidebar (usually on the left), click on **Publish New Version**.
</Step>
<Step title="Add an Optional Version Message">
You can add a message describing the changes in this version for clarity (optional but recommended).
</Step>
<Step title="Click 'Publish'">
Click the **Publish** button to finalize the publishing process.

</Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully published a new version of your private plugin. This version is now available for selection when installing your plugin in Amplication services and templates.
