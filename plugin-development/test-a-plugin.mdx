Amplication provides **Dev Versions** to streamline your testing process, allowing you to rapidly iterate and validate your plugin changes directly within your development environment before publishing.

## Why Use Dev Versions for Plugin Testing?

Dev Versions are designed to minimize friction and accelerate your plugin development workflow by:

<Card title="Eliminate Publish Cycles" icon="rotate">
Instead of needing to publish a new plugin version every time you make a code change, Dev Versions automatically use the latest code directly from your plugin's Git repository.
</Card>
<Card title="Seamless Integration" icon="code-merge">
Dev Versions integrate directly with your existing Git-based development workflow, making testing a natural part of your plugin creation process.

## Step 1: Enable Dev Versions for Your Plugin

Before you can start testing with Dev Versions, you need to enable them for your private plugin in the Amplication Platform Console.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Private Plugins">
Go to your project's **Platform Console** from the top header and click on the **Private Plugins** tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Your Plugin">
Choose the private plugin you want to test from the list.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Dev Version Toggle">
In your plugin's settings, locate the **Enable Dev Version** toggle and switch it to the **on** state.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
When Dev Versions are enabled, Amplication will automatically pull the latest plugin code from the base branch specified in your [Git Settings](/day-one/resource-git-setup) whenever you use this plugin in a service or template.
</Note>

## Step 2: Install Your Plugin with the Dev Version

To actually use the dev version for testing, you **must** specifically select it when installing the plugin in a resource.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Services or Templates">
Go to the **Service Catalog** and select a resource. Usually, this will be a test resource that is not used in production for testing purposes.
</Step>
<Step title="Go to the Plugins Tab">
In your resource, click on the **Plugins** tab.
</Step>
<Step title="Install Your Private Plugin">
Find your private plugin in the **Private Plugins** section and click **Install**.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the 'Dev Version' in Plugin Settings">
After clicking "Install", or in case the plugin is already installed, click on the settings button to view the plugin settings page and crucially ensure that the version dropdown is set to "@dev".

</Frame>

</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
For Dev Versions to be active, you **must** both enable the "Dev Version" toggle in the plugin settings **and** select @dev during plugin installation in your resource. If you skip the version selection during install, you will be using a published version instead of your latest development code.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Once you are satisfied with your testing and ready to share your plugin more broadly, you can proceed to the [publish your plugin](/plugin-development/publish-a-plugin) guide.
